# Baroque music

You may or not may know I love classical music. In fact, one of the articles I enjoyed writing the most was [an illiterate's guide to classical music](https://lucapette.me/writing/an-illiterate-guide-to-classical-music).

A note (about a note, yeah that's me) about this list: you'll definitely notice
Bach isn't present in the list. It's because he deserves a list of his own. Ask
and I'll deliver one.

A few days ago, a friend asked me to share some of my favorite baroque music pieces. Let's see:

- [Les Sauvages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQiBIb_klT8) by Jean-Philippe
  Rameau is _the_ composition that comes to my mind when I think of baroque
  music. It works surprisingly well on guitar, see [Raphaël
  Feuillâtre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHtTEEejrbo). This may have
  something to do with Raphaël Feuillâtre being a genius too.
- [Le Rappel des Oiseaux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqP8sR0u49w) by
  Jean-Philippe Rameau is another piece. This has a special place in my heart
  because of the incomprehensible ability by the guitar Duo assad to play this
  to absolute perfection. [You don't have to believe me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKmoLkjXEg8).
- The Neapolitan Domenico Scarlatti wrote 555 keyboard sonatas. I made a point
  of listening to all of them more than once. Superb compositions. Here's a few
  of my favorites:
  - [Sonata in D minor, k1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSP2jR39Eig) is what
    Scarlatti is to me. What a superb composition. And if this sounds impossible to play on the guitar, you'd be right if [Aniello Desiderio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRR7-lIAjPk) didn't exist.
  - [Sonata in D minor, k141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh9WX7TKfkI)
    played by legend Martha Argerich is a must-listen. Sergio & Odair Assad,
    obviously, have an [incredible version]( Martha Argerich) too.
