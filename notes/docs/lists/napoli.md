# Napoli

A list of places I recommend to people that have never been to my hometown.

- [Nennella](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d785643-Reviews-Da_Nennella-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html)

  Traditional, cheap, super funny. Max 15 euro per person. If they have it, try
  "pasta e patate", it's incredible.

- [Pizzeria
  Sorbillo](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1034513-Reviews-Sorbillo-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html)

  Top pizza place (top 5 are all same level) in Napoli. Among the cheapest and
  my personal favourite. Best pizza: Nonna carolina. With pesto.

- [Antico forno
  Attanasio](https://www.yelp.com/biz/antico-forno-attanasio-napoli)

  Pastry place. They make "sfogliatella" which is very local (and very good).
  There are two kinds: "frolla" (my fav) and "riccia". I suggest you try both
  üòÅ.

- [Gelateria Bilancione](https://www.yelp.com/biz/gelateria-bilancione-napoli)

  Incredible ice-cream place.

- [Salita della
  pedamentina](http://www.napoliunplugged.com/salita-della-pedamentina-naples.html)

  Very nice walk down the city centre. A nice way of starting it is getting off
  at "piazza vanvitelli" metro station and go up to the "castel sant'elmo"
  (which is a beautiful place and a very good spot for seeing the whole city
  from above. Pictures from this vantage point are famous)

- [Museo San Severo](http://www.museosansevero.it/it/)
- The most beautiful sculpture I have ever seen. Breathtaking, highly recommended.

- [Museo Capodimonte](http://www.museocapodimonte.beniculturali.it/)

  Beautiful place, nice and interesting museum. You can see Napoli from an
  interesting position and there's generally pretty good lemon based granita
  around.
