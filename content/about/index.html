  <span class="sr-only">Hi!</span>
  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I was born in Napoli (land of 🍕 and ☀️) in
  1982. Since the summer of 2012, I have been living in Berlin (land of 🥙 and
  🌥). This page is a collection of random, hopefully a little amusing, facts
  about me.

  I grew up playing guitar and reading books. I have a computer science degree
  which I never collected the official papers for. I also never used it despite
  I work as a software developer ever since I graduated.
