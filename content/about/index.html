  <div class="sr-only">I</div> was born in Napoli (land of 🍕 and ☀️) in 1982. Since the summer of 2012,
  I have been living in Berlin (land of 🥙 and 🌥). This page is a collection of
  random, hopefully a little amusing, facts about me.
</p>
  
  <p>I grew up playing guitar and reading books. I have a computer science
  degree which I never collected the official papers for. I also never used it
  despite I work as a software developer ever since I graduated.
