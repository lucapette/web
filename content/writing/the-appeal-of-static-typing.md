Before I dive into the topic, let me make some premises:

- The point of the article isn't to say statically typed languages are better
  than dynamically typed ones. That means nothing. The point is to share how my
  perspective changed over the years. I find myself wanting to refer to this
  article often in conversations with other programmers. Now it's there so I can
  refer back to it when I need to.
- I'm not trying to convince you that you should drop your favourite language
  and go for the ones I'll discuss in the article. It's really just me sharing
  my experience, hoping some people will find it useful.
- Writing about this is quite a challenge for me personally. I have always had
  problems expressing my opinion when I personally find something obvious. In
  this context what I find obvious is that statically typed languages lead to a
  better programming experience. Because it's obvious to me, it's hard to
  articulate. So here we are, I never say no to a writing challenge.

While the premise should clarify I mean everything that follows as my personal
opinion, I want to share the journey that got me here so that, if you do not
know me personally, you know it's informed by more than two decades of
programming.

I started my programming journey in the early 2000s, I was a computer science
student at the University of Naples, Italy. We did mostly C. I liked it,
actually. It was difficult but very satisfying, I learned a lot.

At the time I had to discuss my thesis in graphs algorithms, I realised I needed
a way to plot lots of data. I run into Perl. Such a different experience from C!
I liked how quickly I could get something working together.

As soon as my professional career started, I did mostly Java for a better part
of a decade of professional experience. I went through two jobs where I wrote a
lot of Java before starting to feel a little discouraged by how slow things
moved in the Java world. So I started looking for something different. That's
how I found Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

My world view was shattered, everything magically worked. I remember the first
time I read something like:

```ruby
class Post
  has_many :comments
end
```

my Java brain exploded. I couldn't understand how any of it worked, I _had_ to
understand how this worked. So I spent a few years in the the land of
dynamically typed languages. The euphoria kept me going for a while.
Meta-programming was cool, RSpec was cool. The community was fantastic.

## Focus on "actual" tests

## The tooling

    * IntelliJ
    * vs code

## The workflow


## Experience is everything
