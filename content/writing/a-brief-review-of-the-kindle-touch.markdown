title: A brief review of the kindle touch
---

I generally write about Vim or Rails but this will be a small exception.  I'm
writing about this little amazing device because a lot of people I respect
(like [@sickill](https://twitter.com/sickill)
[@wikimatze](https://twitter.com/wikimatze) and
[@_solnic_](https://twitter.com/_solnic_) to cite some) asked me for feedback
since I tweeted about my love for the kindle touch a number of times.

Let's proceed in order.

I'm a book lover. I don't mean only technical books. I love reading novels.
And I love books. I mean the dead tree ones. I like to smell paper and ink of
any kind of book. Brand-new ones and old ones. I love the sound of turning
pages and I like to compare different editions of the same novel. Maybe you're
wondering why I'm telling you that. Well, I hope this preface will be good
enough to help you understand how much I was sceptical about owning an
electronic book reader.

I was wondering if the experience of reading a great book would be the same
using a cold, lifeless e-book. I was asking myself how readable would be a
kindle touch compared to a paper book. I was sceptical but I kept reading a
lot of good feedback about the device, and my wife gave me a kindle touch as a
present a couple of months ago.

I wrote such a preface to transmit I wasn't at all convinced a kindle was
worth buying. In general, I think if you love books as much as I do you simply
wouldn't need such a device. Well, it left me surprised for the first time
when the delivery guy brought it home. The weight and the dimensions are
perfect. For some reason, I was sure it should have been more heavy. It fits
perfectly in my hands. But this surprising feeling is nothing compared to the
killing feature of the kindle. The *readability*. I know, I'm sure you're
going to say that of course it's more readable than a monitor. But that is not
surprising. The really surprising thing is that it's actually more readable
than an average book. It really is. I was shocked by its readability.

Since my wife bought me the kindle touch I read about 15 novels and two
technical books. The experience with novels (or more generally non-technical
books) is absolute fantastic. There is no reason to buy a dead tree version of
this books if you have a kindle. And it should be even more friendly for the
environment. The experience with technical books is a bit different. I guess
it really depends on the book you're reading. I read [Practical
Vim](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) (that you should buy if you
use Vim) and [Object on Rails](http://objectsonrails.com/) (You should read
this too if you want to avoid the ordinary Rails spaghetti-code architecture).
Well, it has been a bit difficult to follow long code examples. I've the
impression that the device should be a bit bigger for these kind of books.

So my final response is: if you read a lot of non-technical books you'll love
it. It's just perfect and I could not be more happy. On the other
hand, if you are considering buying it for just technical books I'm not
totally sure you'll be enthusiast about it as much as I am.
