  I had a nice conversation about one-on-ones with a friend via email and
  this article wraps it up.

title: Some notes about one-on-ones
---

A few premises to start with:

- Before I started having regular one-on-one meetings, I was very sceptical.
- I now consider one-on-ones one of the most powerful tools a manager can use to
  help their team.
- Don't take this article as a set of rules, I'm just sharing my opinion and
what I learned about the matter in the past few years.

There are a lot of questions to answer about one-on-ones. The frequency, the
outcomes, how to plan the meeting. Before I get to them, I want to highlight
what I think is the most important aspect of one-on-ones: this meeting is not
for the manager. It is a very powerful tool as long as your direct reports use
the meeting for their own needs. This is crucial, everything I discuss follows
this principle.

Now the details:

- How to plan a one-on-one

  I personally don't really plan them. As I said above, I consider them a tool
  for the person "on the other side" of the meeting. I ask them how they want to
  use the meeting. We want to get to a point where both parties look forward to
  the meeting. It's a meeting to clarify doubts, misunderstandings. It's
  helpful. We can talk about things that aren't strictly related to work if we
  feel like. Sometimes work isn't about work.

- The frequency

  Once again, these meetings are not for you, the manager. You don't get to
  choose the frequency if you're doing it for your reports, the choose. My only
  requirement is an upper bound: not less than once per month. It can be once
  per month, once per week, every day or whatever. It does not really matter;
  what does matter is that I am not the one who needs the meeting.

- The outcomes

  This is what requires more care. You definitely don't want to use the meeting
  to set up or review expectations. Set up specific meetings for those. The
  outcome of one-on-ones is a direct consequence of the topics you discuss. It
  can be very different things. It can be something like "let's figure out
  together how to decrease bugs", "please tell me next time I get angry and I
  don't notice so I can improve", "let's work with X on Y because you both can
  benefit from the experience". Again, it can be anything.

Generally, I explain these points during the first one-on-one I have with people
that join my team. Then I take it from there.

If you keep it as free-form as possible, you'll see a very interesting
phenomenon: each person will use the meeting in a different way. You'll see some
themes being developed more than others depending on the person.

If the experience varies a lot, you're doing it right. People are different: you
don't want to treat them all the same way. You want to be equally fair with all
of them. Some need to focus on technical matters, others on communication,
collaboration. That's the point. It's their meeting, let them choose what to do
with it.

When I sent the first draft of this article to a friend via email, his first
reaction was: "From what you've just described, your idea of one-on-ones looks
like 2 people grabbing a coffee and having a chat, which I seriously believe is
good! But how can you not lose the "meeting-ness"?".

That is a good question. I do think these meetings should feel informal,
somewhat different from the rest of the meetings you have. If you really stand
by the principle that you shouldn't be driving these meetings, then it will be
more formal with some people and "exactly like going for a coffee" with other
people. Making it serious and official makes it boring and "standard" too.

Let your direct reports go wherever they want to go with them. You'll love the
results.
