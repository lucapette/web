  I had a nice conversation about one-on-ones with a friend via email and
  this article wraps it up.

title: Some notes about one-on-ones
---

One-on-one meetings is a very interesting topic and, as always, everyone has an
opinion. I do too and I'm going to share mine, so please don't take this as a
set of rules. It sums up what I've learned about the matter in the last few
years.

Two premises to start with:

- I was very skeptical about this kind of meetings at first as I considered it
  a manager's tool. It is not. More about this later.
- I now consider one-on-ones one of the most powerful tools a manager can use to
  help their team.

With those two points in mind, I think there are a lot of questions to answer
about one-on-ones. The frequency, the outcomes, how to plan the meeting. Before
I get to those points, I would like to highlight what I think is the most
important aspect of one-on-ones: this meeting is not for you, the manager. It is
a very powerful tool as long as the people you're having one-on-ones with use
the meeting for their own needs. This is absolutely crucial, the rest of the
discussion makes no sense at all otherwise.

Now the details:

- How to plan a one-on-one

  I personally don't really plan them. As I said above, I consider them a tool
  for the person "on the other side" of the meeting. So I ask them how they
  want to use the meeting as long as we are on the same page. We consider it a
  tool to make us happier. To clarify doubts, misunderstandings. We talk about
  things that aren't related to work if we feel like.

- The frequency

  I know some people need reminders to set up one-on-ones. I think this
  already explains very well people miss the point. Once again, these meetings
  are not for you, the manager. You don't get to choose the frequency. My only
  rule is an upper bound: not less than once per month. Now, it can be once
  per month, once per week, every day or whatever. It does not really matter;
  what does matter is that I am not the one who needs the meeting.

- The outcomes

  This is the most dangerous part. You definitely don't want to use the
  meeting to set up or review expectations. If you feel those things matter to
  you (I don't necessarily think "setting up expectations is required"), set
  up a focused meeting on this matter. The outcome of one-on-ones is a direct
  consequence of the topics you get to discuss during the meeting. It can be
  very different things. It can be something like "let's figure out together
  how to decrease bugs", "please tell me next time I get angry and I don't
  notice so I can improve", "let's work with X on Y because you both can
  benefit from the experience". Again, it can be anything.

Generally, I explain those things I have just explained here during the first
one-on-one I have with people that join my team. And then I take it from there.
If you keep it as free-form as possible, you'll see a very interesting
phenomenon: each person will use the meeting in a different way. You'll see
some themes being developed more than others depending on the person. If the
experience varies a lot, you're doing it right. People are different, you don't
want to treat them all in the same way. You want to be equally fair with all of
them. Some need to focus on tech things, others on soft skills. And that's the
very core of my point. It's their meeting, let them choose what to do with it.

When I sent the first draft of this article to a friend via email, his first
reaction was: "From what you've just described, your idea of one-on-ones looks
like 2 people grabbing a coffee and having a chat, which I seriously believe is
good! But how can you not lose the "meetingness"?". That is actually a good
point. The idea you may get here is: I think these meetings should be very
informal. The core point will anyway remain the same: you shouldn't be driving
a single one-on-one. It will be more formal with some people and "exactly like
going for a coffee" for other people. Making it serious and official makes it
boring too, like most meetings. You have to let the other person go where they
want to go. You'll love the results.
