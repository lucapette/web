Degas is a well-known French painter. Less-known is the fact that he played
around with poetry. One day he explained to the poet Stéphane Mallarmé his
struggle with writing. He said he had many ideas and yet he couldn't write.
Mallarmé answered:

> Poems are not made out of ideas. They're made with words.

There it is. That's the best definition of writing I've ever heard come across.
It's all about the words. The way you connect them, the way you get rid of them.
It's about each sentence you choose, how you craft the rhythm of your sentences.
I learned that varying between short sentenced and longer ones gives a personal
rhythm to your writing. It helps my writing a great deal. I just did that.

I have always dedicated time to writing. Moving to Germany had a big impact on
it, because speaking a different language at work fundamentally changed the
way I think. I often find myself thinking in English. I dream in English.
While I'm grateful about the experience, it had a negative impact on my
writing. I feel limited when I write in English. I know I'm not a native
speaker and I feel it every single time I write. My writing isn't clear and
fluid, there's too much clutter. I'm a clumsy person in every day life but
I've never felt that way in writing. My experience at school spoilt me. I used
to always be the "good writer" in any class. I put no effort and yet my
writing was good. The distance between my experience with Italian writing and
English writing blocked me. I did not know how to fix it and a few years
passed. That's how life works: if you do nothing, nothing happens. But I
couldn't give up on writing. I like it too much. I like the act itself, it
calms me down. It gives me the silence that's so hard to find in this frenetic
world.

I did what I always do when I want to know more about something: I read a few
books. I must confess I was sceptical about reading on writing. I've always
thought of writing as something you're good at; that was my experience as an
Italian student. By now, I'm convinced nothing works like that. And I'm happy I
could get past this prejudice (that's all it is). Here is a list of books I
read with a short review:

- *The element of style* It's the classic everyone recommends. And rightly so:
  it's a **must-read**. If you care about improving your English writing, this
  is the book for you. I have not got around to buy a dead-tree version yet, so
  I'm using my Kindle application to consult it every now and then. But it
  deserves to live on one's desk.
- *On writing well* It's a good book. I loved the first chapters, but I can't
  say I liked the rest of the book as much. After the introduction, each chapter
  covers writing techniques on different topics (like travelling, interviews)
  and some of them were too boring. I did skip some chapters, overall a good
  read.
- *Writing tools*  Above-mentioned books can teach you most of what matters
  about writing in English, so this book may feel a little repetitive. I enjoyed
  it anyway for two reasons:
  - Each chapters comes with a workshop section. The information is helpful and
    actionable. Great features.
  - Some repetition doesn't hurt when you're learning.

Reading these books taught me that writing works like everything else. Put
hours of practise in and you will get better. That's common sense: you want to
get better at something, you practise it. But we're not taught like that when
it comes to writing. The problem is that we think of artists as people with
innate talent. You're either born like Dostoevskij or you'll always write
crap. Of course, this isn't true. First of all, the goal isn't becoming the
most important novelist of the history. The goal is to enjoying writing. The
goal is to feel confident about sharing what you write. If you don't intend to
write for money, you can ignore the audience. I suggest you do that anyway
though. More on this part later.

## Rewriting is the best part of writing

These books taught me something else. They changed my perspective on the
writing process. It was a radical and enlightening discovery. They taught me
to love the rewriting process. Before this experience, I had been considering
the following steps:

- Research the topic
- Take notes
- Get the draft

Then I would proof-read the draft with the help of someone else's eyes and I
would call it a day. It was a presumptuous process. These books, in particular
*on writing well*, teach you to love the rewriting process, they help you
understand its value. I realised I could work on my drafts and apply the rules I
was learning. It was a fascinating discovery. I built some confidence as I could
see I was learning. My sentences were getting better, the proof-reader started
having an easier life.

Rewriting my drafts generated a series of ideas that made me love writing even
more. It forced me to think of ways to get to the first draft as fast and as
effortlessly as possible. That changed everything for me and two techniques
emerged in very little time:

- Note by note.
- Outline expansion.

I couldn't come up with a better naming for now, as a programmer I know how hard
naming can be. I will explain what I mean in the coming paragraphs.

As I kept rewriting my drafts before moving on to proofreading, I realised I had
never written a draft and rewritten it in one sitting. I had always put at least
a few hours between the sessions. My personal explanation is that writing a
draft and rewriting one require different mindsets. When I write a draft, my
goal is to write everything I want to write so I can move on to the _real_ work:
the rewriting sessions. When I rewrite something, my goal is to remove all the
clutter. I want to get rid of whatever is superfluous: unnecessary adverbs,
adjectives, sentences or even entire paragraphs. Rewriting keeps my ego healthy.
I have to tell myself "get rid of this entire paragraph you spent 30 minutes on.
It doesn't say anything".

One question I feared when I started to rewrite my drafts was "how much
rewriting is enough?" It's a fair question, it comes up often when I talk about
writing to people. I don't know if there's an answer that works for everyone. I
don't believe answers have such a feature. But I can share what I do: I have an
upper limit of three sessions. I gave myself a hard non-negotiable limit because
I'm sure there's always room for improvement. The limit helps me to move on to
other things and constrains the amount of time I spend on a single piece of
writing. The time constraint gets the best out of me. I focus deeply on what I'm
writing and those sessions make me feel satisfied and productive.

## Note by note

I have been trying to write every day for a long time, yet I've struggled to
come up with topics I wanted to write about. A few weeks ago, I started looking
into React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces). I was completely
new to the topic and the ecosystem around React can be overwhelming. I started
taking notes to help me with the learning process. After a couple of coding
sessions I was looking at my notes and I realised I could transform them into a
draft with little effort. That was the first time I used the _note by note_
technique.

I started taking notes about everything I do. I don't care if what I'm writing
down is worth sharing or not. I don't even ask that question. The point is to
give myself a chance to take a bunch of notes and transform them into a draft at
a later stage. Now I can get from notes to a first draft of over a thousand
words in thirty minutes. This is really fast for me.

Nowadays, when I'm about to run out of items in my draft queue, I check my
notes. And I always find something I can expand into an article. I found a way
to write every day. It _only_ took me seven years.

## Outline expansion

I use [outlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)) every time I
have no clue what I'm doing. As that's true for most of what I do (and yes,
that's true for you too. Don't lie to yourself), I organise lists this way every
day. When it comes to writing, it helps me to structure ideas that have been on
my mind for a while. This article is a perfect example. As soon as I started
researching how to improve my English writing, I knew I would want to write
about it at some point. I outlined my thoughts like this:

```
on writing

- use all the day one writing with the "on writing" tag
- Books I read quick review
  - The element of style
  - On writing well
  - Writing tools
- The absolute necessity of getting an editor
- Make a habit out of it
- Build a drafts queue
- Get to the draft as fast as you can:
  - note by note
  - outline with paragraph expansion (use the article itself to explain it)
- Share everything you write (example of the vim article)
```

This is the actual outlined list I used for the article you're reading. I shared
the raw version so that it's easier to explain how I use outlined lists. In
short, it's a guideline for my thoughts. It works like this:

- I paste the outlined list into my editor.
- I expand one point after the other.
- If a point doesn't fit where it is, I move past it.
- If I'm left with points I couldn't expand, I get rid of them.

As you can see from the example above, "make a habit out it" and "the absolute
necessity of getting an editor" did not make it to the final article. I believe
they are important topics but I couldn't find a way to make them flow with the
rest of the content. Furthermore, "get to the draft as fast as you can" ended up
being three different paragraphs. While writing the article, I realised I cared
too much about "rewriting", so only mentioning it didn't work.

As with the "note by note" technique, I try to expand all the points in one
session, but it doesn't always work for me. Sometimes I get tired of using this
technique, because I don't have enough content in the outline list already. In
that sense, the "note by note" technique works better as it's faster. For
example, I wrote the first draft of this article in one sitting. It took me less
than two hours and I couldn't be happier with the result. But it was almost
1900 words and the writing session left me very tired.

## Share everything you write

We have the tendency to overestimate our forecasting capabilities. It's called
[overconfidence effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect). I
feel the effect of this bias every time I publish something. 2017 is a perfect
example: the only article I thought wasn't worth sharing got more attention than
the rest of the articles together. I couldn't believe it. I decided that the
best strategy against this bias is ignoring it completely. I won't ask myself if
an article is worth sharing or not. I'll share whatever I write because I love
writing. Besides, from time to time someone tells me they found my writing
helpful. That's a beautiful and powerful idea: I do something just because I
like it and that helps someone else. I wish many more things in life would be
like writing.

Thank you for reading me and stay tuned for the next article!
