If [someone](https://twitter.com/taniarascia) I admire encourages me to
[write](https://twitter.com/taniarascia/status/1522337429881081856) about
something, I will. So here we go again.

A few weeks ago, Tania asked an intriguing question on twitter:

> Does anybody have a really good system for organizing utils/helpers? Or is it
> always just chaos?

My default answer to util modules is "don't create them". As I said in the
conversation with Tania, it may sound cheeky but I'm not trying to be funny or
clever about it. I say "don't have util modules" because I genuinely believe
that's the best way to organise them.

## It's always Chaos
  
## If you already have them, get rid of them

## If you don't, never introduce them

## Purpose driven internal packages work
