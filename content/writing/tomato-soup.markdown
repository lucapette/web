I invented this recipe after playing around with a few blog posts I found on
tomato soups. I like that it's neither too spicy nor too sweet, but both
characteristics are very present in the taste. It's easy and fast to prepare -
a perfect soup for a winter evening. If you like wine, then a strong red is
the perfect companion.

## Ingredients

_Serves four_

- A spoonful of olive oil
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 big carrots
- 2 medium onions
- 4-5 large red tomatoes
- A spoonful of tomato paste
- 1 liter of vegetable broth
- A spoonful of Ras el hanout
- 1 small chili pepper
- Salt to taste
- Oregano to serve
- Estragon to serve
- 1 cup crème fraîche

## Tools

- A knife
- A chopping board
- A big pot
- A wooden spoon

## Instructions

- Finely chop the garlic and the onions
- Chop the carrots into small cubes, and halve the tomatoes
- Place the pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and the chili pepper
- Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and the onions, followed by the carrots
- After a few minutes, add the tomato paste and mix together until
  all the ingredients are coated with the paste
- Add the tomatoes
- Crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon while they cook
- Add the broth
- As soon as the broth stats boiling, add the ras el hanout and salt to taste
- Turn the heat down to a simmer
- Cook until the soup reaches the density you like the most

## Serving

Enjoy it!

## Notes

If you don't have vegetable broth on hand, you can substitute it with a
bouillon cube. The procedure is the same.
