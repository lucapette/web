In my career, I worked in very different contexts, covering all kind of product
development related roles. Two patterns emerged quickly and stayed with me in
all the jobs I have had but the very first ones:

- I built teams and systems from scratch many many times
- I have always had direct reports

Looking back, this has always been a little puzzling to me.

Some sort of strange chicken and egg problem I was never able to untangle: Did I
_always_ find myself in leading positions because I'm good at it? Or did I
become good at it because I _always_ had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer but I bring this up in the
context of an article called "my engineering management values" because it's
relevant to the conversation.

Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Let's start
from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is trust. The people you manage trust you
have their back. They trust your focus as a leader is their growth and
well-being.

A couple of things are worth underlining. First of all, using "leader" instead
of "engineering manager" is a conscious choice. It allows me to provide a small
distinction.

While it's true I have been in positions of leadership for the majority of my
career, I never held the title of engineering manager. More specifically, I was
never only responsible for the people part of leading developers.

I underline this because I can back up "I'm a good leader" with examples from my
career but I can't actually say "I'm a good engineering manager". In fact, I'm
not so sure I'm fit for the job.

That's the other thing I wanted to underline here: I'm not sure I would know how
to gain trust from developers without deep technical conversations.

I know this may be controversial but if I'm writing about my engineering values,
the least I can do is to be honest about my ideas. Yes, the underlining idea is
that I don't know how to lead engineering teams without the technical trust.

I'm also not saying it's the only way. I'm providing context about what my
experience has been so that, once I discuss my values, it's clear how I apply
them to the job.

Before I move on to the values themselves, let me address why I think the fact
I've been leading teams all my career is also relevant to this article.

What interesting about this is that in every single job I took, I felt "tricked"
into leading developers. The data point being I did _not_ want to lead developers.

The number one reason why I took on the job was always a mix of two things:

- It was easy for me. More about this in a minute.
- I would rather do lead a team so I could self-organise than "just" be a team
  member and have a terrible manager. Unfortunately, every single engineering
  manager I have had, it has been between really terrible and just terrible.

After 20 years, I learned this are not good reasons to lead teams so, at the
time of writing, I'm not sure I'd accept a leadership job.

When I say "it was easy for me", I'm not trying to brag. It's kind of a sad
thought really.

I didn't feel I was doing anything special:

Trust the people, treat them with respect. Convince them
to do something, instead of telling them what to do. Let them make mistakes, and
make sure they understand your no-go (I'll provide examples of this in [lead by
example](#lead-by-example)).

I have always thought the average manager out there must be very bad
if doing what I just said is enough to be a good one (and often "the best I
had").

It felt very easy to be better than average. That's the sad thought.
