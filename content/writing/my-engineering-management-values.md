In my career, I worked in very different contexts, covering all kind of product
development related roles. Two patterns emerged quickly and stayed with me in
basically all the jobs I had but the very first ones:

- I built teams and systems from scratch many many times
- I have always had direct reports

To me, this has always been a little puzzling. Some sort of strange chicken and
egg problem I was never able to untangle. Did I find myself _always_ in leading
positions because I'm good at it? Or did I become good at it because I _always_
had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer but I bring this up in the
context of an article called "my engineering management values" because it's
relevant to the conversation.

Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Let's start
from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is trust. The people you manage trust you
have their back. They trust your focus as a leader is their growth and
well-being.

A couple of things are worth underlining. First of all, using "leader" instead
of "engineering manager" is a conscious choice. It allows me to provide a small
but crucial distinction.

## one-to-ones
## Written communication
## Lead by example
## Fire fast, hire slow
## No privileges
## Be vulnerable
