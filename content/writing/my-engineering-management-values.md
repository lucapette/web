{{< message class="is-info">}} This is a _long_ read. You will find a table of

In my career, I worked in very different contexts, covering all kind of product
development related roles. Two patterns emerged quickly and stayed with me ever
since:

- I built teams and systems from scratch many many times
- I have always had direct reports

Looking back, I find that this is a tad puzzling. Some sort of strange chicken
and egg problem I not really able to untangle: Did I _always_ find myself in
leading positions because I'm good at it? Or did I become good at it because I
_always_ had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer.

I bring this up in the context of an article called "my engineering management
values" because it's relevant to the conversation. Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Especially for
readers that do not know me personally (if that's you, hey ðŸ‘‹ nice to meet
you!). Let's start from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is "many things but everything derives from
trust". The people you manage trust you have their back. They trust your focus
as a leader is their growth and well-being.

Trust is the common denominator of all my values.

A couple of things are worth noticing already. First of all, using "leader"
instead of "engineering manager" is a conscious choice. It allows me to make a
small distinction.

While it's true I have been in positions of leadership almost all my career, I
have never held the title of engineering manager. More specifically, I was never
responsible only for the people part of leading developers.

I underline this because I can back up "I'm a good leader" with examples from my
career but I can't actually say "I'm a good engineering manager". In fact, I'm
not so sure I'm fit for the job.

That's the other thing I wanted to underline: I do not know how to gain trust
from developers without deep technical conversations.

Be aware I'm not saying it's the only way. I'm providing context about what my
experience has been so that, once I discuss my values, it's clear how I apply
them to the job.

Before I move on to the values themselves, let me address why I think the fact
I've been leading teams all my career is also relevant to this article.

What interesting about this is that in every single job I took, I felt "tricked"
into leading developers. The data point being I did _not_ want to lead developers.

The number one reason why I took on the job was always a mix of two things:

- It was easy for me. More about this in a minute.
- I would rather lead a team so I could self-organise my own time than "just" be
  a team member and have a terrible manager. Unfortunately, every single manager
  I had apart from one (hey [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabiansiegel) ðŸ‘‹) has
  been between extremely terrible and really terrible.

After 20 years, I learned that these are not good reasons to lead teams so, at
the time of writing, I'm not sure there's an engineering leadership job in my
future.

When I say "it was easy for me", I'm not trying to brag. It's kind of a sad
thought really. Let me explain.

I always thought what my "leadership style" was nothing special:

- **Trust** the people
- Treat them with respect
- Convince them to do something instead of telling them what to do
- Let them make mistakes
- Make sure they understand your no-go (I'll provide examples of this in [lead
by example](#lead-by-example)).

The average manager out there must be very bad if doing what I just said is
enough to be a good one. Often "the best I had".

The sad thought is that it felt very easy to be better than average.

With that out of the way, let's dive into it.

## One on ones

One on ones are the very core of my leadership style. I would not know how to
lead a team without them.

The goal for me is to create a safe environment where my direct reports and I
can trust each other.

There is a lot of advice around how to structure and how to run one to ones. I
can't offer any of that though as I actively try to avoid structure. What drives
my approach is this:

> People are different and you want to treat them differently. You do not want
> to treat all of them the same way: you want to be equally _fair_ with all of
> them.

I don't plan one on ones so that there's enough room for the other person to
make use of the meeting. There's no discussion to plan because my job is to
listen.

I settled for asking people how they want to use the meeting. They know better
than me what they are struggling with. I ask questions to clarify doubts and
misunderstandings.

If people want to talk about things that are not work related I do not drive the
conversation back to work. One on ones are wonderful because they create the
space to know each other better.

There is one thing I do plan carefully though: my action points after a one to
one.

Succeeding at creating a safe space for people to tell you what bothers them and
what their aspirations are creates great expectations. People trusted me so now
I have to "prove" they did the right thing.

It took me too long to understand I needed to take great care of the action
points that a one on one generates. That is the main reason why I think you can
hardly can have more than 5 or 6 direct reports _and_ do a good job at the same
time. It is too much work and too much information. It becomes too easy to make
mistakes.

One to ones make sense only as recurring meetings, so their frequency is
relevant to the conversation.

I don't choose or have a standard frequency.

Different people have different needs, let them choose how often they want to
meet with you. My only requirement is an upper bound: not less than once per
month.

It can be once per month, once per week, every day or whatever. In my
experience, the frequency tends to stabilize between every two weeks and once
per month.

I keep the meeting informal and, if people are fine with it, do it outside the
typical office setup. Having the meeting outside the standard setup helps you
send reinforce the message "this meeting has a special meaning because it is
only about you". The meetings will be more formal with some people and "exactly
like going for a coffee" for other people. Both are fine.

I wrote some [notes about one to ones]({{< ref
"/writing/some-notes-about-one-on-ones" >}} "my some notes about one on ones")
if you're looking for more details.

## Written communication

I was, and still am, a big fan of in-person, face to face, meetings. They worked
great for me as a leader when I had small teams to take care of. And I still use
this approach as my primary communication style when I can.

Unfortunately, when I started leading more than one team (defined by the
two-pizza rule) at the time, I quickly realised this communication style
wouldn't scale.

Lots of people felt out of the loop, there was no structure around how my teams
committed decisions. It made sense: my communication style was, by definition,
non-inclusive. Either you were there or you weren't.

I started writing things down for my teams and never looked back ever since.
It's now my favourite communication style to broadcast information.

There's structure about how I treat different written communication channels. My
value is exactly that: written words shouldn't always have the same weight. The
context matter quite a bit. Let me break it down.

### Chats

I'm deliberately silly in chats. I make jokes, I police people out of slack
threads if the conversation gets serious.

This attitude is designed to constantly send the message that chats aren't the
place for any serious work.

I may use a chat as a secondary broadcast channel. Meaning I link important
writing living somewhere else (like an google doc or a github issue) in a chat
with relevant people while adding the reminder to discuss anything related to it
in the relevant place.

### Design proposals

When I'm designing a non trivial feature, I most often use google docs as a
starting point.

It's an approach that is very indicative of my leadership style: I want to make
sure we're going in a direction I'm comfortable with (so I often draft a first
version) while making sure people have the time and place to contribute as much
as possible to the design.

I love the approach: it's more inclusive than a meeting because it doesn't
require any attendance at a specific time and also requires less maintenance
from me as a moderator. Discussions in the written form tend to be more
thoughtful than in-person ones because people have time to think things through.

Now I also require people in my teams to approach large features this way. My
experience has been that forcing people to write down their plans improves the
quality of the plans themselves.

### Meeting agendas

Writing detailed meeting agendas is a relatively cheap way to ensure meetings
are useful and moderated correctly. The idea is that I always share:

- what's the point of the meeting
- what are the topics we want to cover (order often relevant)
- what's the expected outcome

This simplifies my job a little as I can quickly context-switch into "meeting
mode" as soon as I read the agenda therefore helps me moderate it correctly.

If the meeting is about some on-going topic, I most likely have a google doc
attached to it so we can take real-time notes about the meeting.

It's a lot of work and that's the point. If we so badly _need_ to take time out
of other's people day, it means the topics are important and need to be treated
accordingly.

I don't always enforce a "no agenda no meeting" policy. While I personally like
it very much, I found that meeting culture is too company specific for such a
strict rule to always work.

### Developers' book

Early in my career I got very frustrated every time I joined a new team. Most of
the day by day operations were just not documented.

So when it was my time to design an on-boarding experience, I realised I could
make use of written communication by creating a "developer's book".

That is document providing at least the following information:

- How to on-board
- How we work
- How we operate
- How to off-board

The idea is that if someone is unsure about how to approach a problem, they have
some information as a starting point.

I use this list as a table of contents for a first draft of this document.

I store the developers' book wherever we store code because it allows me to
implement a process that is beautiful in its simplicity: I ask my teams to
discuss changes via pull-requests.

The developers' book repository then becomes the point of reference for every
discussion about the way the teams operate.

When we agree to change something, we merge the pull request that started the
conversation. As a great side-effect, the developers' book is always in sync!

Of course, the table of contents I provided is just an example. It does not try
to be specific by design. Different companies have different need for this
channel. Good examples of topics you may want to cover in the document are:

- Diagrams (sequences, architecture)
- Incident management
- Reference readings

The only requirements are: slow pace change and, as always, people needs for
information.

### Internal blogging

I call this communication channel "blogging" for lack of a better term. What I
mean is that I always have a place where I can share long pieces of writing.

The main reason is that I want to be able to refer back to specific content over
time. I found that repetition is very much needed when leading any group of
people.

Writing a "blog post" is also my favourite way to smooth difficult operational
transitions that occur in the lifetime of a company.

For example, I wrote internal blog posts about "the benefits of
mono-repositories", "why we're going to use trunk based development", or "the
next generation of our Kafka infrastructure".

I share such blog posts much before the actual transition happens so that I have
time to collect feedback and minimise the situations in which change occur and
people didn't know about it.

As the teams scale, sharing knowledge becomes more and more important to avoid
that different teams solve the same problem multiple times. A great way of
sharing knowledge is writing about what you learned in an internal blog.

So that's the other main reason why I myself write these blog posts. It paves
the way for other people to write.

Fostering a culture of writing helps your teams in many ways:

- Learning to be a better writer helps becoming a better developer.
- People can proudly share their achievements and simultaneously help other team
  members learning something new.

The first question that comes to mind is what is the right topic for blog posts?
A good answer is whatever people feel like sharing.

I avoid policing content: people must be free to share what they think it is
important to share.

It only works if people use it as an actual blog, because that is the only way
to ensure usage spreads among team members.

Bonus side-effect: internal blogging makes public blogging much easier.

The delta between "something we wrote for ourself" and "something we want to
share with the world" is often small, so internal blogging facilitates public
blogging.

A public blog is a great marketing activity for your teams, it helps with hiring
and improves the mood of your teams. It can feel great to share what you are
doing with the rest of the world.

## Lead by example

I believe leading by example is the best way to shape culture.

Instead of telling people how to behave, be the person you want your direct
reports to be.

Leading by example does wonders because it is self-reproducing. People have the
tendency to emulate the behaviour of those they trust.

If people trust you as a leader, you can shape the culture of your team _just_
by doing what you think it is right.

This applies to everything. Because the point is that we do a lot of things at
work every day so as a leader I often felt overwhelmed by the idea that "people
are observing my behaviour".

The way I overcame this problem is by making sure I know what are the boundaries
of my values. The idea is that I clarify, with daily examples, what are the
things I really care about. Let me provide some real world examples from my
teams:

- I call out people using non-inclusive language
- I leave at 6pm unless the system is on fire
- I don't give up on a disruptive production issue unless it's solved
- I don't have chats systems on my phone
- I don't work outside of working hours
- You can't really reach me when I'm off

These are just examples, the point is that I learned you can't tell people
things and expect them to follow you. You have to be that person yourself first.

It's obviously harder to lead by example when the teams get larger. Most of the
people will not interact with me every day so I can't really show them my boundaries.

Once again, written communication comes very handy. I write down "do and don't"
documents for the team.

These documents look a little like the list I just shared but they use a
different writing style. Items look like "Use inclusive language" or "it's
always OK to ask questions".

## Fire fast, hire slow

Most startups hire fast and fire slow and that is considered somehow normal. I
apply the reversed principle: hire slow and fire fast.

This sounds great in theory but, to be fair, it is hard to practice because:

- You could always do more with more people
- Hiring has no short term positive performance effect on you teams

So there's quite some incentive on hiring people really fast especially in a "VC
backed startup".

Unfortunately, hiring cannot fix _now_ problems. It is an investment for the
future of your teams. I try to stay ahead of my own needs and hire just a little
before I actually need more people.

This also helps me making sure I can actually hire slowly. Because while I'm
interviewing people, I'm not trying to solve a now problem.

Hiring slow is how I minimize false positives. If I hire the wrong people, the
best you can do is to fire them.

Unfortunately, that is an awful solution. Firing is always a failure: something
went wrong and now there is no better option than giving up.

Firing is ugly, there is no better way to put it. That is why I advocate doing
it as soon as possible. I think of firing as the worst possible outcome of the
on-boarding process which I organize in the following checkpoints:

- First day
- First week
- First month
- First quarter

There is more to on-boarding than just looking for hiring failure, but le me
focus on that aspect here.

In first few days, I only look for big red alerts. The kind of inappropriate
behaviour that must result in immediate firing; sexist or racist behaviour comes
to mind.

The first month checkpoint is the first chance for both parties to ask
themselves if they did the right thing. A month is generally enough to assess if
you enjoy working together or not.

At the three month checkpoint, I ask myself the question "do I want to work with
this person for the next X years?"

If the answer is not "Of course, she is awesome!" I know I have a problem to
fix.

Sometimes though, people do not fit anymore. They have been working with you for
a while and they realize they are not happy anymore.

Companies are living entities and they evolve so fast there is nothing wrong
about this.

In such cases, I pay extra attention about how I let people go. It is easy for
both parties to show lack of care and leave behind a bad feeling.

The solution is talking as much as possible about it. They helped you achieve
your goals, now it is your turn to show them you appreciate what they have done.

Some people do not behave nicely in their last weeks and it can happen even with
people you really liked working with. It is human: their heart is somewhere else
already and they cannot help it.

Observe the situation closely. If it gets unprofessional, talk to them and let
them go as soon as possible. It is the best option.

## No privileges

In most environments, there is some degree of privilege when it comes to
specific topics like deployment rights, access to different environments. A
common explanation for these privileges is risk mitigation. Those in charge want
to minimize the mistakes made so they grant privileged access only to a handful
of people.

This approach creates a false sense of security but in fact they are
not doing better than any other company out there. They have outages and break
things like everybody else.

In reality, these privileges create the worst dynamic: it frustrates newer team
members because they cannot access some fo the obvious knowledge that would
increase their seniority and makes sure only senior people can make mistakes.

So at some point in my career, I got rid of all privileges because I realised
that:

> Everyone can do everything does not mean everyone will

On average not much changed in terms of risk. I did not get more outages. But I
saw people grow faster.

I apply the "no privileges" policy aggressively. People should not be confined
to only one phase of the product development process.

Of course, people specialize because they care more about one thing or the other
and it is important they can freely develop in the direction they want.

Our systems are too complex for people to know the details of everything. But I
do not assign those any privilege.

In fact, I reject the notion of privilege entirely. If one can do something in a
team, everyone else can too.

## Be vulnerable

[Leading teams by example](#lead-by-example) has an obvious downside: people
tend to emulate your mistakes too.

It has always been difficult for me: my own mistakes as acceptable behaviour.

When I figure out I made a mistake, I just go with radical honesty about it. I
will tell my team why what I did is a mistake, I apologise, and commit to do
better.

This too is leading by example because that's precisely the kind of behaviour I
want to see in the people I work with. The message is:

- It is OK to make mistakes.
- This behaviour is not up to my own values.
- I must do better.
- So must everyone else.

This dynamic has a positive effect on you too. Being a good leader means helping
people go wherever they want to go.

The key is showing them your decision-making process, your behaviour at time of
crisis.

Doing so reduced the number of operational decisions you have to make
every day.

Sharing your own mistakes with your team can be a powerful moment of
self-reflection.
