In my career, I worked in very different contexts, covering all kind of product
development related roles. Two patterns emerged quickly and stayed with me in
all the jobs I have had but the very first ones:

- I built teams and systems from scratch many many times
- I have always had direct reports

Looking back, this is a tad puzzling to me.

Some sort of strange chicken and egg problem I not really able to untangle: Did
I _always_ find myself in leading positions because I'm good at it? Or did I
become good at it because I _always_ had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer but I bring this up in the
context of an article called "my engineering management values" because it's
relevant to the conversation.

Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Especially for
readers that do not know me personally (if that's you, hey ðŸ‘‹ nice to meet
you!). Let's start from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is "many things but everything derives from
trust". The people you manage trust you have their back. They trust your focus
as a leader is their growth and well-being.

A couple of things are worth noticing already. First of all, using "leader"
instead of "engineering manager" is a conscious choice. It allows me to provide
a small distinction.

While it's true I have been in positions of leadership for the majority of my
career, I never held the title of engineering manager. More specifically, I was
never responsible only for the people part of leading developers.

I underline this because I can back up "I'm a good leader" with examples from my
career but I can't actually say "I'm a good engineering manager". In fact, I'm
not so sure I'm fit for the job.

That's the other thing I wanted to underline: I'm not sure I would know how to
gain trust from developers without deep technical conversations.

I know this may be controversial but, if I'm writing about my engineering
values, the least I can do is to be honest about my ideas. Yes, the underlining
idea is that I don't know how to lead engineering teams without the technical
trust.

I'm not saying it's the only way. I'm providing context about what my experience
has been so that, once I discuss my values, it's clear how I apply them to the
job.

Before I move on to the values themselves, let me address why I think the fact
I've been leading teams all my career is also relevant to this article.

What interesting about this is that in every single job I took, I felt "tricked"
into leading developers. The data point being I did _not_ want to lead developers.

The number one reason why I took on the job was always a mix of two things:

- It was easy for me. More about this in a minute.
- I would rather lead a team so I could self-organise my own time than "just" be
  a team member and have a terrible manager. Unfortunately, every single manager
  I have had so far apart from one (hey
  [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabiansiegel) ðŸ‘‹), it has been between extremely
  terrible and really terrible.

After 20 years, I learned that these are not good reasons to lead teams so, at
the time of writing, I'm not sure there's an engineering leadership job in my
future.

When I say "it was easy for me", I'm not trying to brag. It's kind of a sad
thought really. Let me explain.

I always thought what my "leadership style" was nothing special:

Trust the people, treat them with respect. Convince them to do something instead
of telling them what to do. Let them make mistakes, and make sure they
understand your no-go (I'll provide examples of this in [lead by
example](#lead-by-example)).

The average manager out there must be very bad if doing what I just said is
enough to be a good one. Often "the best I had".

It felt very easy to be better than average. That's the sad thought.

With that out of the way, let's dive into it.

## One on ones

One on ones are the very core of my leadership style and I would not know how to
lead a team without them.

There is a lot of advice around how to structure and how to run one to ones. I
can't offer any of that though as I actively try to avoid structure: the meeting
is about one person at the time. The core value being:

> People are different and you want to treat them differently. You do not want
> to treat all of them the same way: you want to be equally _fair_ with all of
> them.

The goal is to create a safe environment to foster trust. You cannot help people
if you do not know what their inspirations are, what they struggle with, what
annoys them. Many people do not feel they have the space at their daily job for
figuring out their professional and personal development. Most people will never
bring up such vulnerable topics without a safe space. It is your job as a leader
to create such a space.

If you are planning one on ones, it means you are not leaving enough room for
the other person to make use of the meeting. You cannot plan the discussion
because your job is listening. Ask people how they want to use the meeting. Your
job is to help them and most likely they know better than you what they are
struggling with. Ask questions to clarify doubts and misunderstandings. If
people want to talk about things that are not work related do not drive the
conversation back to work. One on ones are wonderful because they create the
space to know each other better. It is quite ironic how this works: we spend
more hours per week with people we know very little about than with people we
know everything about. I am not sure how it works in other industries, but I am
sure we cannot do a good job building software if we do not know what is going
on with the rest of the team members. It is basic human decency and common
sense. The strength of a team comes from its collective intelligence: the better
people know each other, the better their collaboration.

Even more ironic is how reluctant people are when I talk about one on ones as a
meeting in working hours that is not about work. To be fair, my phrasing is not
great, I say one on ones are not about work and that is true only if you
consider work as a set of tasks to accomplish. My point is that we should not
have such a narrow view one what work is. We work with people and people
complete the tasks, so one to ones are about the core of the job: the people
doing it.

There is one thing I learned to plan carefully though: my action points after a
one to one.

One on ones can dramatically improve a relationship, but they can destroy it
too.

I did learn the hard way, and so did many leaders I mentored.

Succeeding at creating a safe space for people to tell you what bothers them and
what their aspirations are creates great expectations. People trusted me now I
have to "prove" they did the right thing.

It took me too long to understand I needed to take great care of the action
points that a one on one generates. That is the main reason why I think you can
hardly can have more than 4 or 5 direct reports _and_ do a good job at the same
time. It is too much work and too much information. It becomes too easy to make
mistakes.

One to ones make sense only as recurring meetings, so their frequency is
relevant. My advice is to not choose the frequency yourself. Different people
have different needs, let them choose how often they want to meet with you. My
only requirement is an upper bound: not less than once per month. Now, it can be
once per month, once per week, every day or whatever. I am serious though, you
work for the people, remember? If a members needs to meet you every day for a
while, there is no good reason to say no. In my experience, the frequency tends
to stabilize between every two weeks and once per month. You should not be the
one choosing how often to meet because it is not your meeting. During the first
one on one, I explain the meeting is for them and they can use it whatever way
they prefer which includes how often they want to meet.

It is not easy to figure out if you are doing a good job with one on ones. A
clear sign is one on ones that have a different focus, mood, and rhythm
depending on the person. If the experience varies a lot, you are going in the
right direction.

Keep the meeting informal and, if people are fine with it, do it outside the
typical office setup. Long walks are healthy and stimulate good conversation, so
that is a good choice and creates a ritual. Having the meeting outside the
standard setup helps you send reinforce the message "this meeting has a special
meaning because it is only about you". The meetings will be more formal with
some people and "exactly like going for a coffee" for other people. Both are
fine.
