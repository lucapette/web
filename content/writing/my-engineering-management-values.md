In my career, I worked in very different contexts, covering all kind of product
development related roles. Two patterns emerged quickly and stayed with me in
all the jobs I have had but the very first ones:

- I built teams and systems from scratch many many times
- I have always had direct reports

Looking back, this is a tad puzzling to me.

Some sort of strange chicken and egg problem I not really able to untangle: Did
I _always_ find myself in leading positions because I'm good at it? Or did I
become good at it because I _always_ had to lead people?

To be honest, I'm not so sure what's the right answer but I bring this up in the
context of an article called "my engineering management values" because it's
relevant to the conversation.

Two reasons:

- I'm self-assessing as a "good leader".
- I've been in leadership positions literally all my career.

Both worth addressing before I move forward to discuss my values. Especially for
readers that do not know me personally (if that's you, hey ðŸ‘‹ nice to meet
you!). Let's start from "good leader".

What makes a good leader? My answer is "many things but everything derives from
trust". The people you manage trust you have their back. They trust your focus
as a leader is their growth and well-being.

A couple of things are worth noticing already. First of all, using "leader"
instead of "engineering manager" is a conscious choice. It allows me to provide
a small distinction.

While it's true I have been in positions of leadership for the majority of my
career, I never held the title of engineering manager. More specifically, I was
never responsible only for the people part of leading developers.

I underline this because I can back up "I'm a good leader" with examples from my
career but I can't actually say "I'm a good engineering manager". In fact, I'm
not so sure I'm fit for the job.

That's the other thing I wanted to underline: I'm not sure I would know how to
gain trust from developers without deep technical conversations.

I know this may be controversial but, if I'm writing about my engineering
values, the least I can do is to be honest about my ideas. Yes, the underlining
idea is that I don't know how to lead engineering teams without the technical
trust.

I'm not saying it's the only way. I'm providing context about what my experience
has been so that, once I discuss my values, it's clear how I apply them to the
job.

Before I move on to the values themselves, let me address why I think the fact
I've been leading teams all my career is also relevant to this article.

What interesting about this is that in every single job I took, I felt "tricked"
into leading developers. The data point being I did _not_ want to lead developers.

The number one reason why I took on the job was always a mix of two things:

- It was easy for me. More about this in a minute.
- I would rather lead a team so I could self-organise my own time than "just" be
  a team member and have a terrible manager. Unfortunately, every single manager
  I have had so far apart from one (hey
  [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabiansiegel) ðŸ‘‹), it has been between extremely
  terrible and really terrible.

After 20 years, I learned that these are not good reasons to lead teams so, at
the time of writing, I'm not sure there's an engineering leadership job in my
future.

When I say "it was easy for me", I'm not trying to brag. It's kind of a sad
thought really. Let me explain.

I always thought what my "leadership style" was nothing special:

- Trust the people
- Treat them with respect
- Convince them to do something instead of telling them what to do
- Let them make mistakes
- Make sure they understand your no-go (I'll provide examples of this in [lead
by example](#lead-by-example)).

The average manager out there must be very bad if doing what I just said is
enough to be a good one. Often "the best I had".

The sad thought is that it felt very easy to be better than average.

With that out of the way, let's dive into it.

- [One on ones](#one-on-ones)
- [Written communication](#written-communication)
- [Lead by example](#lead-by-example)
- [Fire fast, hire slow](#fire-fast-hire-slow)
- [No privileges](#no-privileges)
- [Be vulnerable](#be-vulnerable)

## One on ones

One on ones are the very core of my leadership style and I would not know how to
lead a team without them.

My goal is to create a safe environment where my direct reports and I can trust
each other. I cannot help people if I do not know what their inspirations are,
what they struggle with, what annoys them. Most people do not feel they have the
space at their daily job for figuring out their professional and personal
development. They will never bring up such vulnerable topics without a safe
space.

There is a lot of advice around how to structure and how to run one to ones. I
can't offer any of that though as I actively try to avoid structure: the meeting
is about one person at the time. The value driving my approach is this:

> People are different and you want to treat them differently. You do not want
> to treat all of them the same way: you want to be equally _fair_ with all of
> them.


I don't plan one on ones so that there's enough room for the other person to
make use of the meeting. There's no discussion to plan because my job is to
listen.

I settled for asking people how they want to use the meeting. They know better
than you what they are struggling with. I ask questions to clarify doubts and
misunderstandings.

If people want to talk about things that are not work related I do not drive the
conversation back to work. One on ones are wonderful because they create the
space to know each other better.

It is quite ironic how this works: we spend more hours per week with people we
know very little about than with people we know everything about.

Even more ironic is how reluctant people are when I talk about one on ones as a
meeting in working hours that is not about work.

To be fair, my phrasing is not
great, I say one on ones are not about work and that is true only if you
consider work as a set of tasks to accomplish.

My point is that we should not have such a narrow view one what work is. We work
with people and people complete the tasks, so one to ones are about the core of
the job: the people doing it.

There is one thing I do plan carefully though: my action points after a one to
one.

Succeeding at creating a safe space for people to tell you what bothers them and
what their aspirations are creates great expectations. People trusted me now I
have to "prove" they did the right thing.

It took me too long to understand I needed to take great care of the action
points that a one on one generates. That is the main reason why I think you can
hardly can have more than 5 or 6 direct reports _and_ do a good job at the same
time. It is too much work and too much information. It becomes too easy to make
mistakes.

One to ones make sense only as recurring meetings, so their frequency is
relevant to the conversation.

I don't choose or have a standard frequency.

Different people have different needs, let them choose how often they want to
meet with you. My only requirement is an upper bound: not less than once per
month.

It can be once per month, once per week, every day or whatever. In my
experience, the frequency tends to stabilize between every two weeks and once
per month.

I keep the meeting informal and, if people are fine with it, do it outside the
typical office setup. Having the meeting outside the standard setup helps you
send reinforce the message "this meeting has a special meaning because it is
only about you". The meetings will be more formal with some people and "exactly
like going for a coffee" for other people. Both are fine.

## Written communication

## Lead by example

I believe leading by example is the best way to shape a good culture.

Instead of telling people how to behave, be the person you want your team
members to be.

Leading by example does wonders because it is self-reproducing. People have the
tendency to emulate the behaviour of those they trust.

That is good news: if people trust you as a leader, you can shape the culture of
your team _just_ by doing what you think it is right.

Sometimes staying true to your values puts pressure on the decisions you have to
take. The most obvious example of this problem is the situation in which you end
up doing something by yourself instead of teaching your team how to do it. That
happens because it is easier to just do something that teaching other people.
And sometimes you are really short on time. I have been there many times. And
while I do not regret getting things done, I wish I had spent more time sharing
my struggle with my teams. Staying true to your values can work against "getting
it done", and that is hard to fight. On one side, you do not want external
pressure to get into your team. On the other, you really need to get that thing
done now. The problem is that delegating work may delay it a little. I incite
you to go slower and take the pressure on you when you can, but do not be afraid
of doing it by yourself. Sometimes, it is good for you because it is liberating
to see things done with your own hands. In both cases though, what really
matters is that you share your struggles with the team. Help them understand the
important of the work to do and help them see you as a human being that
sometimes give in a little to the external pressure and loosen up their values.
The message, again, is using vulnerability as a leadership technique. Let people
see who you are, the closer they see you the better you will understand them
and, therefore, help.

There is always some distance between your personal values and the values you
share with your teams. Trying to be oneself at work is important, but human
beings are complex and it would not be realistic to expect an absolute perfect
match between personal and professional values. But it can be stressful at times
to work with the distance, so I suggest you write down your core values. A
bullet list with give or six ideas is enough. You can think of this exercise as
a writing a concise essay about "what is leadership at our company". As always,
sharing it with the team is a great idea, contributions to this document are
vital to a healthy culture.

## Fire fast, hire slow

Most startups hire fast and fire slow and that is considered somehow normal. I
apply the exact reversed principle: hire slow and fire fast. This sounds sounds
great in theory but, to be fair, it is hard to practice. Growing companies are
constantly understaffed and hiring is the only way to overcome the problem. It
took me a while to accept that:

- You could always do more with more people
- Hiring has no short term positive performance effect on you teams

More people in your team means you could be doing that one thing you never
manage to do. It is a stressful feeling and I had hard times coping with it at
times. But I learned there is always an opportunity hidden behind every problem.
Here the opportunity is to do more with the people you already work with. Make
sure you always share with your team your hiring plans: it is a great
introspection process. People come up with plans to do more with less when they
have a better understanding of what is missing and what is relevant for the
upcoming future.

More people means more communication to manage, it is an obvious and necessary
overhead. Expecting spikes in the performances of your team is wrong. Instead,
plan for the obvious drops accordingly. Hiring cannot fix your _now_ problems,
it is an investment for the future of your teams. Stay ahead of your own needs
and hire just a little before you need more people. This is how to make hiring a
slow process: you are always hiring for what you do not need just yet. As soon
as you find yourself saying "we need X developers now", you are three or four
months late and the problem is you cannot recover from such a delay.

Hiring slow is your opportunity to minimize false positives too. If you hire the
wrong people, the best you can do is to fire them. Unfortunately, that is an
awful solution. Firing is always a failure: something went wrong and now there
is no better option than giving up.

Firing is ugly, there is no better way to put it. That is why I advocate doing
it as soon as possible. I think of firing as the worst possible outcome of the
on-boarding process which I organize in the following checkpoints:

- First day
- First week
- First month
- First quarter

There is more to on-boarding than just looking for hiring failure, but le me
focus on that aspect for now. In first few days, I only look for big red alerts.
The kind of inappropriate behaviour that must result in immediate firing; sexist
or racist behaviour comes to mind. The first month checkpoint is the first
chance for both parties to ask themselves if they did the right thing. A month
is generally enough to assess if you enjoy working together or not. At the three
month checkpoint, I ask myself the question "do I want to work with this person
for the next X years?" and if the answer is not "Of course, she is awesome!" I
know I have a problem to fix. Tell people the truth: explain in details your
expectations and what is not working. Follow up closely, as much as once per
week for a few months if needed. It is expensive, but it pays off if you are
proactive. Following up closely will generate a reaction and that will help you
make the right decision. There are three possible outcomes:

- The problem gets fixed fast
- The problem gets worse fast
- Nothing happens

It is easy to deal with the first two cases. If the problem gets fixed, great
news: you can work with this person. If it does not, bad news but you now know
you cannot work with this person. It gets trickier when nothing happens. In my
experience, this is the worst case scenario because you will not be able to
recover from this situation, but you cannot say for sure yet. Maybe you cannot
connect with the new member in order to help or, worse, they do not even care
about the issues you brought up. Talk to them every day if needed. If nothings
changes you hired the wrong person or they chose the wrong company. The actual
reason does not make any difference to what you need to do.

Sometimes though, people do not fit anymore. They have been working with you for
a while and they realize they are not happy anymore. Companies are living
entities and they evolve so fast there is nothing wrong about this. In such
cases, you have to pay extra attention about how you let people go. It is easy
for both parties to show lack of care and leave behind a bad feeling. Once
again, the solution is talking as much as possible about it. They helped you
achieve your goals, now it is your turn to show them you appreciate what they
have done. Some people do not behave nicely in their last weeks and it can
happen even with people you really liked working with. It is human: their heart
is somewhere else already and they cannot help it. Observe the situation
closely. If it gets unprofessional, talk to them and let them go as soon as
possible. It is the best option.

## No privileges

In the chapter "evolving teams", I spend a great deal of time talking about how
to organize teams. Organizational design is such an important and fascinating
topic to me, I dedicate a chapter to it. But the way you organize functions and
roles inside teams plays a central role in culture too.

The cultural aspect of organizational design starts with privileges and
policies. In most environments, there is some degree of privilege when it comes
to specific topics like deployment rights, access to different environments. A
common explanation for these privileges is risk mitigation. Those in charge want
to minimize the mistakes made so they grant privileged access only to a handful
of people. This approach creates a false sense of security but in fact they are
not doing better than any other company out there. They have outages and break
things like everybody else. In reality, these privileges create the worst
dynamic: it frustrates younger team members because they cannot access some fo
the obvious knowledge that would increase their seniority and makes sure only
senior people can make mistakes. Getting rid of all forms of privilege may sound
scary, but there is no need to freak out:

> Everyone can do everything does not mean everyone will

On average not much changes in terms of risk. You will not get more outages. Why
would you? Leaving the doors open increases the chances of getting a smarter
team.

If you remove all privileges, chances are someone will mistakes that are a
direct consequence of their ability to access everything. As a leader, you will
find yourself wishing a team member did not have access to that part of the
system. The train of thoughts is so common: "if she did not have access to the
server, that incident would have not happened". It can lead you to believe that
a degree of privilege is a practical answer. You would be fooling yourself:
trying to avoid mistakes is a silly strategy and builds a silly culture.
Mistakes will happen and, as a leader, you must welcome them because you can
teach people how to react to them and what they can do so that the problem
doesn't occur again. Use mistakes as a learning opportunity.

Apply the "no privileges" policy aggressively. People should not be confined to
only one phase of the product development process. Of course, people specialize
because they care more about one thing or the other and it is important they can
freely develop in the direction they want. Our systems are too complex for
people to know the details of everything. But do not assign those specialties
any privilege. In fact, I reject the notion of privilege entirely. If one can do
something in a team, everyone else can too.

In my career, I could not always apply a full "no privilege" policies. That is
possible only if who is in charge fully supports the policy. Working in teams
that foster a privilege-based culture has been a frustrating experience, but it
gave me the opportunity to gather interesting data. I had a chance to A/B test
policies. In more than 15 years of data collection, I observed that privileges
have no effect on the amount of incidents. Moreover, the people making "big
mistakes" were most times the most senior in the team. The same people that
would have had the privileges to perform the task anyway if there were a policy.

## Be vulnerable

[Leading teams by example](#lead-by-example) has an obvious downside: people
tend to emulate your mistakes.

It has always been difficult for me: my own mistakes have be seen as acceptable
behaviour. Then it becomes hard to push the bar higher because, well, you did
not live up to your own values. When you figure out you made a mistake, I
suggest you to be honest and open about. Showing yourself as vulnerable has a
positive effect on the entire team, because you are saying:

- It is OK to make mistakes.
- This behaviour is not up to our values.
- You must do better.
- So must everyone else.

This dynamic has a positive effect on you too. Being a good leader means
bringing people where they want to go. The key is showing them your
decision-making process, your behaviour at time of crisis. Doing so reduced the
number of operational decisions you have to make every day. Sharing your own
mistakes with your team can be a powerful moment of self-reflection.
