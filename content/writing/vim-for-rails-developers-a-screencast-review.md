title: "Vim for rails developers: a screencast review"
---

I have recently published my first
[article](/vim-for-rails-developers-what-you-cant-miss/) of this series. It got
nice feedback which encourages me to keep writing. As part of the feedback I got
a very nice email from [Ben Orenstein](http://codeulate.com/). He was so kind to
send me a copy of his screencast [Vim for
rails](http://www.codeulatescreencasts.com/products/vim-for-rails-developers),
asking me for feedback. So, here we are. I was already familiar with most of the
topics covered in the screencast and I think this is a good point if you were
asked for feedback. I would like to cover it in an article because Ben’s work is
definitely worth spreading.

## The screencast

The screencast has a good recording quality and Ben speak a very clear English
(it does count for non-native speakers you know :)). So I think you should be
able to follow without problems. Furthermore, the screencast is neither long nor
short, the length is just perfect.

### Introduction

The screencast starts with a short and nice introduction. It shows you how
to improve your typing skills, Ben gives you nice suggestions on resources
you should use for the matter.

### Rails.vim

The part about [rails.vim](http://rails.vim.tpope.net/) has a very nice subtitle
and introduces to you the most important features of rails.vim. Ben shows you
how to familiarize with Rfind, one of the most important commands of rails.vim
(I still prefer
[FuzzyFinderTextMate](https://github.com/jamis/fuzzyfinder_textmate) though). He
follows with the explanation of the R\* command set. Then he gives you a very
good explanation of the _gf_ feature, describing it with a perfect definition
_context-aware_. Ben covers the most important aspects of rails.vim and he
finishes his tour with various examples of the _related-files_ feature of
rails.vim.

### Snipmate

I’m going to talk about
[snipmate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540) in my
next article of the series, because I really love it and advise everyone
to use it :) By the way, Ben covers it very well, showing you many good
examples and helping you personalize them.

### Tags

Tags feature is one of the most interesting features of vim and I
completely agree with Ben on the necessity of covering it in a screencast.
Ben presents [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) and performs a
complete description of tags features in vim. Furthermore, he gives you
nice tips on how to use tags from the command line.

### Ack

I wasn’t familiar with [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) and I want to thank Ben
for introducing it to me. Now I use it on a daily basis and I can say it’s
better than grep, ~~practically~~ (see comments) it's grep for programmers (Ben
defines like that as well). Ben will convince you to use it with a perfect
example, giving you tips on its configuration. Of course, the part contains some
good advice on ack using within vim.

### Quick-notes

I think you should buy this screencast even only for this part of the
screecast. Ben will show you a bunch of great tips and I’m sure they will
be a great source of inspiration for learning some little-known vim
features. In my humble opinion, this is the best part of the whole
screencast. It will definitely help you to make a step further in your
vim.

## Conclusion

So here we are. I think the point is _Should I buy it?_ and I want to answer
straight away. Yes, you should. It will give you great information and
inspiration. You get a product of great value for little money.
