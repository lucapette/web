Hi everyone,

Finally, I have a new site. For months I've been thinking about the idea of
building a new one. I was searching for a new way of handling my semi-static
content and I found a system I really like.

The content of the site is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the site itself is hosted by [github](http://pages.github.com):

- [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

  I like it. It is simple and light and has all the features I need for my
  site. It is well-designed and it is simple to use. Jekyll has a lightweight
  configuration and you can create a site within minutes.

- [github](http://pages.github.com)

  I really like the work done by the github folks and I really like git. I use
  it for all my project, I use it even at work (I say _even_ because I work in
  Italy, you know). So the idea of pushing a commit on a git repository and
  having my changes published on my site immediately is something I find
  wonderful.

I like my new creation (especially considering my web design limits) and I hope it will help me to post more often.
