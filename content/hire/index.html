    <span class="dropcap">Hi!</span>
  </span>
  <span class="sr-only">Hi!</span>

  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I'm a polyglot developer (Java, Ruby,
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Kotlin) <span class="accent">available</span> for hire.
</p>

<p> Check out my
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucapette/">Linkedin</a> profile for a
  detailed overview of my work experience and education.
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Over the past two decades, I run engineering teams in a wide variety of
contexts: corporations, family run businesses, early stage startups.</p>

<p>
  In each of these experiences, a recurring theme emerged: <span
class="accent"><b>I built many teams and system from scratch</b></span>.
</p>

<p>This thought me when it's the right time to shift from fast prototyping to
lean, sustainable product building.
</p>

<p>Since I was always in a position of leadership in the past 15 years, I have
experience building and running infrastructure, backend, data, frontend, mobile
and systems.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I'm the most fluent solving infrastructure, data, and
backend problems because that's where I spent most of my programming career.</p>

<p>While designing UI and UX is not my strong suit, I have lots of experience
building JavaScript and TypeScript application. I'm also very fond of React.</p>

<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>

<p>Apart from some <a href="#deal-breakers">deal breakers</a>, I can work on any
problem.</p>

<p>I get the most excited when I can work on <span
class="accent"><b>infrastructure</b></span> (especially development
infrastructure like testing pipelines, build tools) or
<span class="accent"><b>streaming data platforms</b></span> (I have lots of
experience with Apache Kafka, its ecosystem, and streaming platforms in
general).</p>

<p>Having said that, here's the details:</p>

<h3>Problem space</h3>

<p>I prefer working on one large, difficult problem at the time over many simple
problems one after the other.</p>

<p>Solving one large problem at the time often leads to long-lasting mutually
beneficial working relationship because it's where my technical and leadership
skills converge.</p>

<p>I'm good at breaking down large problems into small, simple artifact. I can
write design proposals for them and coordinate the work.</p>

<p>I tend to get bored after a few weeks if the problems I'm working on are all
simple.</p>

<p>I can do that quite efficiently though because leading engineering teams made
me pretty good at context switching.</p>

<h3>Role</h3>

<p>As a freelancer, I've been hired in all kind of positions: ad-interim CTO,
programmer, hiring manager, and so on.</p>

<p>That means no</p>

<h3>Time commitment</h3>

<h2 id="deal-breakers">Dealbreakers</h2>

<p>
  While I enjoy working pretty much on any product, do <b>not</b> contact me for
  anything <i>blockchain</i>, and <i>army</i> related.
</p>

<p>
  I also tend to say no to anything advertising related. I may want to make an exception if both of the following conditions are met:
  <ul>
    <li>the technological stack is highly relevant to me</li>
    <li>the goal of the project you want to hire me for is performance related.
    Making systems use less resources is climate friendly</li>
  </ul>
</p>
