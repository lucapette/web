  <span class="sr-only">Hi!</span>

  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I'm a polyglot developer (Java, Ruby,
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Kotlin) available for hire. Check out my
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucapette/">Linkedin</a> profile for a
  detailed overview of my work experience and education.

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  Over the past two decades, I had the privilege to run teams in a wide variety
  of contexts: corporations, family run businesses, early stage startups.</p>
  
<p>In each of these experiences, a recurring theme emerged: <b>I built many
teams and system from scratch</b>. I learned when it's the right time to shift
from fast prototyping to lean, sustainable product building.
</p>

<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>

<h2>Dealbreakers</h2>

<p>
  While I enjoy working pretty much on any product, do <b>not</b> contact me for
  anything blockchain related.
</p>

<p>
  I also tend to say no to anything advertising related. I may want to make an exception if both of the following conditions are met:
  <ul>
    <li>the technological stack is highly relevant to me</li>
    <li>the goal of the project you want to hire me for is to performance
    related. Making systems use less resources is climate friendly</li>
  </ul>
</p>
