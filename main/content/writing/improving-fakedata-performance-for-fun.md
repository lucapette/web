Fakedata is a small CLI (command-line application) that helps you generate data.

Say you need some data to test a feature that requires uuids, emails, and
country codes.

The way you do that with fakedata is this:

```sh
$ fakedata uuidv4 email country.code
b4469d8c-3097-4434-be74-270ce5fc6763 bassamology@test.pid JP
d7a09d09-af98-416f-ab62-ef85a5d172bf megdraws@example.edeka SZ

```

The arguments we're passing to fakedata are called generators. The app supports
a number of "generators" (see the whole list with `fakedata -G`) you can use to
quickly generate data.

It supports a few formatters (including a SQL insert format) so it's also quite
flexible.

You can read about the rest of the features in the
[README](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata/blob/main/README.md).

If you can't find what you're looking for, open an issue and we'll take it from
there.

Now that we know what fakedata does, we can talk about improving its
performance.

## Why am I doing this?

A few days ago, I found myself thinking "so how fast is fakedata, really?"

The question caught my attention because it immediately generated (pun _not_
intended) two intriguing follow-up questions:

- [How do I get a sense of fakedata performance?](#measure-it)
- [How do I speed this up?](#improve-it)

The program had always felt fast enough so I didn't know if it could generate
hundreds, thousands, or millions of rows per second.

Also, fakedata is just a glorified for loop that prints strings to the standard
output. I wondered what improving its performance meant in practice.

I had some guesses but, as one of my favourite programming principles goes,
[facts > assumptions]({{< ref
"/writing/my-programming-principles#facts--assumptions" >}} "my programming
principles - facts > assumptions"). Better to fact-check my assumptions before
changing any code.

What I'm trying to say here is that I had no practical reason to look into
fakedata performance, it just sounded _fun_.

That's also why I wrote this article. _For fun_.

That and the opportunity this experience would gave me to finally play around
with [datasette](https://datasette.io/).

## Measure it

The first thing I did was to measure fakedata current performance.

To keep things simple, I used [pv](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml):

```sh
$ fakedata noun -l 10000000 | pv -b -l -a -t -n >/dev/null
1.0001 1557682
2.0001 3129185
3.0003 4657761
4.0001 6248907
5.0001 7847980
6.0001 9439419
6.3562 10000000
```

What we're looking at here is a tuple "tick, total_rows_count".

Yes, I agree. I misused pv. But this turned out to be a surprisingly simple way
to get a sense of how fast fakedata was.

In fact, pv's outputs is already quite useful: fakedata outputs roughly around
1.6 million rows per second.

Not bad for a totally un-optimised piece of code. Thanks Go!

It sounds really fast, right? Well... it depends 🙃

Let's compare fakedata to the yes command:

```sh
yes | pv -b -l -a -t -n >/dev/null
1.0001 79354880
2.0002 160619520
3.0000 242048000
4.0000 323410944
5.0002 404872192
6.0003 485579776
```

80 million rows per second! That's much much faster than fakedata.

Sure fakedata generates random output but there are almost two orders of
magnitude between the two programs: it's unlikely the random generation makes up
for this difference.

But, again, facts > assumptions.

I don't guess. Even in such a trivial case like this one.

So I wrote this program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 10000000; i++ {
		fmt.Println("yes")
	}
}
```

and run it with pv:

```sh
./yes | pv -b -l -a -t -n >/dev/null
1.0000 1253526
2.0000 2810087
3.0000 4403191
4.0000 6087614
5.0000 7769993
6.0000 9448107
6.3433 10000000
```

12 million rows per second. This implementation of the yes program is as "slow"
as fakedata.

No need for more elaborated diagnostic strategies.

This is enough enough to know where the problem is:

The data generation part doesn't contributed much to the performance of the
program therefore it's writing to standard output that is "slow".

## Diagnose it

Because I was doing this _for fun_, I did run more elaborated diagnostics.

Just an excuse to refresh my memory on Go tooling and check if there was
anything new.

I'm glad I did because I run into very interesting resources. More about this in
a second.

Right after writing the yes program, I decided to benchmark fakedata generators.

Despite it's almost a decade old, [How to write benchmarks in
Go](https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/30/how-to-write-benchmarks-in-go) was still
quite effective in refreshing my memory.

The benchmark confirmed that generating random data is a negligible part of the
process.

After that, I decided to profile the program to confirm the hypothesis from a
different angle.

If you're not familiar with diagnostics in Go, you may want to start from the
the official [Diagnostics](https://go.dev/doc/diagnostics) doc for some basic
definitions.

Go offers a variety of profiler (CPU, memory, and so on). They produce
[profiling data](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof) you can then inspect with a
program called [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/main/doc/README.md)
(the Go team recommends to use it via the tool command: `go tool pprof`).

I used the CPU profile to confirm that fakedata spends most of its time writing
to standard out:

```sh
$ go tool pprof cpu.pprof
Type: cpu
Time: Oct 17, 2022 at 2:58pm (CEST)
Duration: 7.57s, Total samples = 5.89s (77.80%)

     0.04s  0.68% 98.47%      0.04s  0.68%  runtime.pthread_cond_wait
         0     0% 98.47%      5.76s 97.79%  fmt.Fprintln
         0     0% 98.47%      5.76s 97.79%  fmt.Println
         0     0% 98.47%      5.76s 97.79%  internal/poll.(*FD).Write
```

There are other things going on but fakedata spends almost 98% of its time
writing to standard output.

If you're looking to go deeper into profiling, [The Busy Developer's Guide to Go
Profiling, Tracing and
Observability](https://github.com/DataDog/go-profiler-notes/blob/main/guide/README.md)
is an amazing resource. The writing is very engaging. Highly recommended.

OK, now that I knew this was an I/O problem, I could do something about it.

## Improve it

There are many ways to improve the performance of a program.

An effective strategy, especially while dealing with completely naive
implementations, is to _do less_ of whatever you're doing.

This approach works well in this context.

Since I had never written fakedata with performance in mind (it's never been and
still isn't a strict requirement), the implementation was as naive as possible:

- Parse input to figure what we need to generate.
- For each loop step, print a "row" of generated data.

The problem with this approach is that the overhead of asking the host OS "hey
can I write this to stdout?" at every step adds up quickly.

_Doing less_ here means buffering. The idea is that we hold some of the data we
want to write in a buffer so that we can ask the host OS less often "hey can I
write this to stdout?".

It's such a common strategy, most languages have buffered I/O standard
libraries.

Go, being go, has a good one with a funny name:
[bufio](https://pkg.go.dev/bufio).

Here's the tiny change I made to fakedata:

```diff

```

The [whole
commit](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata/commit/4fdd1043234374121ddea555d34c3f229e625e33)
is not much longer than this.

So how much faster is fakedata now? Let's see:

```sh
fakedata noun -l 100000000 | pv -b -l -a -t -n >/dev/null
1.0000 12183541
2.0000 24461371
3.0000 36475245
4.0000 48809688
5.0000 61222503
6.0000 73528343
```

12 million rows per second! A pretty remarkable improvement (almost 10x) for the effort.

It made we wonder how many less systems calls fakedata does now compared to the
naive implementation.

I used [strace](https://strace.io/) to count writes to stdout since the Go
profiler doesn't provide call counts (due its sampling nature).

Here's the writes count before the change (you want to check the "calls" column):

```sh
$ strace -e write -c ./fakedata -l 100000 noun > /dev/null
% time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
100.00    0.333190          16     19785           write
------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
100.00    0.333190          16     19785           total
```

and after the change:

```sh
$ strace -e write -c ./fakedata -l 100000 noun > /dev/null
% time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
  0.00    0.000000           0       227           write
------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
100.00    0.000000           0       227           total
```

The difference makes sense!

## Visualise it

Using pv felt nice because it give me a good sense of fakedata throughput
without having to write a single line of code.

The output was not very readable though.

Not that I'm not blaming pv for this, it felt quite nice I could gather the data
I needed in a few minutes.

Let's look at the output one more time:

```sh
fakedata noun -l 100000000 | pv -b -l -a -t -n >/dev/null
1.0000 12157884
2.0000 24448066
3.0000 36657310
4.0000 48953396
5.0000 61313893
6.0000 73745138
# more of this
```

The first column is just a "tick" every second and the second one is a growing,
large (therefore hard to read) number.

I don't really get a sense of how the throughput is evolving over time: is it
always the same? Are there big drops? Maybe spikes now and then?

It's hard to answer these trivial questions at glance. If I would plot this, it
would be much simpler.

Enter [datasette](https://datasette.io/).

Honestly it's not easy to describe what datasette does (I think even the author
has trouble with that) but, in my words, it's an amazing tool that helps you to:

- Explore datasets you know nothing about.
- Clean-up and visualise small datasets.

It's pretty much perfect for plotting pv output so what I wrote a
[perf.sh](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata/blob/4fdd1043234374121ddea555d34c3f229e625e33/scripts/perf.sh)
that does the following:

- It runs fakedata for a while (in different modes) with the pv command I used
  in this article.
- It loads pv output into a sqlite database using
  [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/), an amazing
  little datasette companion tool which makes working with CSV data very easy.
- It saves into the database two queries that make the data easier to plot. More
  about this in a second.

I plotted the data using
[datasette-vega](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega), a little plugin
that uses the amazing [Vega](https://vega.github.io/) library to plot data.

The graphs look like this:

![fakedata improved perf graph](/img/fakedata-improved-perf.svg)

and it's backed by the following saved query:

```sql
SELECT
  tick,
  rows_done - lag(rows_done, 1, 0) OVER (
    ORDER BY
      tick
  ) rows_done_so_far
FROM
  generator
ORDER BY
  tick
```

It a relatively simple query if you're familiar with the [lag
function](https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html).

I had never worked with datasette and its ecosystem before looking into fakedata
performance.

I'm glad I did because Datasette turned out to be among the most productive
tools I have ever used in my career.

More than enough for something I did just _for fun_.
