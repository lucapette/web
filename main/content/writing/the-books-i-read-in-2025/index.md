I've been debating with myself if writing about the books I read in this
horrendous 2025 would make any sense. And while I concluded that it doesn't,
I'm doing it anyway because it's a perfect excuse to get back to writing.

On a personal level 2025 was very busy so I read a lot less than usual. It
doesn't make sense to get into it here. Writing about moving countries needs
thousands of words and I assume you're here for the books. One relevant
observation though: you can definitely tell I moved at some point as the books I
read changed topic (and language) which is quite unusual for me. Nowadays, I'm
struggling to find my usual reading pace in my new routine but I'm sure I'll
figure it out.

So let's move on to the books now.

## The Origins of the Modern World

{{< book id="214649821" title="The Origins of the Modern World" name="the-origins-of-the-modern-world.jpg" width="200" >}}

A fantastic book on a topic I care very much about (the way I put it: "how did
we get here?"). I learned a lot about history and how history work. The latest,
most recent chapter felt a little weird as some statements are already
inaccurate, others felt a little like the usual western propaganda I'm exposed
to. Having said that, very much a recommended read if you're into history.

## Hold On To Your Kids

{{< book id="39899251" title="Hold On To Your Kids" name="hold-on-to-your-kids.jpg" width="200" >}}

Love/hate this book. I love the content: it helped me a lot to frame my own
behaviour toward my son. I know what I do well and what I don't do well. So in a
way this is a life changing book since it clearly feels like I'm "immediately" a
better parent. The best part of this being it gives you a framework for thinking
about your relationship with your children more than "random" advice.

The hate part: it's not very well written. There's a lot of repetition and the
organization of the book is very frustrating: many chapters about the problems
and then finally a long chapter about solutions. A structure with self
containing chapters would work much, much better. Also, there's a final chapter
about kids and tech and, while I understand why this was added _after_ the book
was written, a much better approach would have been reframing the content in the
light of the modern world (I do understand this is a whole new book).

## Viral Justice

{{< book id="60194743" title="Viral Justice" name="viral-justice.jpg" width="200" >}}

Ruha Benjamin is an amazing writer so I obviously enjoyed reading this book.
Having said that, it’s _very_, and I stress _very_, US-centric. While she
acknowledges this immediately in the book, most of the discourse felt very
specific (and I do understand the idea is to make general arguments). The
central idea of the book, which gives it its title, is very profound though so I
think this is really worth your time.

## Has the West Lost It?

{{< book id="36360063" title="Has the West Lost It?" name="has-the-west-lost-it.jpg" width="200" >}}

A short essay by Kishore Mahbubani. Last year I said I'd read all his books
since I enjoyed his bluntness and writing style. This short book is no
exception. I wish the west would listen. I don't think it will.

## How to Blow Up a Pipeline

{{< book id="51686708" title="How to Blow Up a Pipeline" name="how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline.jpg" width="200" >}}

The book has a strong argument on radical flank theory and climate change. I
felt it was not well organised reading it. Some parts read like a rant, others
like a blog post. Having said that, good content, worth read.

What's really missing from this book is targets. Yes the book deals with
billionaires but, in the context of climate change, you just can't ignore US
imperialism, the military industry, and colonialism.

## Imperialism: the highest stage of capitalism

{{< book id="179609" title="Imperialism" name="imperialism.jpg" width="200" >}}

First of all, Lenin is an amazing writer. Some of his sentences are remarkable.

It's an unfortunately depressing reading though since, to be honest, his core
definitions apply perfectly to our anthropocene age. With the added "bonus" of
climate change. Some very smart people, like Lenin, have been trying to tell us
for a long time we'd end up in this horrific times. Collectively, we're just not
listening.

## Smoke and Ashes

{{< book id="131048198" title="Smoke and Ashes" name="smoke-and-ashes.jpg" width="200" >}}

Maybe a little too long for my interest in the subject. Having said that, it's
the "usual" incredible writing with deep thoughts and reflection on climate
change and colonialism. It has convinced me to buy all books Ghosh wrote.

## Technofeudalism

{{< book id="75560036" title="Technofeudalism" name="technofeudalism.jpg" width="200" >}}

A very confused book.

While the core idea is very powerful the book executes very poorly on it. The
first part of the book is riddled with examples from some TV series (how is that
even remotely a good idea?).

The second part is where things go very badly, very quickly. Varoufakis is so
immersed in his european perspective he offers an incompetent, inaccurate, and
frankly infuriating analysis of the China-US relationship. I'd skip.

## The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida

{{< book id="57224204" title="The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida" name="the-seven-moons-of-maali-almeida.jpg" width="200" >}}

Really well written novel. The lyrical writing may not be for everyone but
really did it for me. I also found quite interesting how personal yet universal
the story told is.

{{</ book >}}

## Has China Won? The Chinese Challenge to American Primacy

{{< book id="51720954" title="Has China Won? The Chinese Challenge to American Primacy" name="has-china-won-the-chinese-challenge-to-american-primacy.jpg" width="200" >}}

This may have been the most interesting book I read from Mahbubani. Especially
because I think it's the one with more flaws. While Mahbubani is clearly not
drowning in western propaganda, he still makes insane arguments ("the US has
done more good than bad" lol). And in this book it happens a lot. Having said
that, still highly recommended reading.

And yes, the question is rhetorical.

## The Divide

{{< book id="36396298" title="The Divide" name="the-divide.jpg" width="200" >}}

Writing a page turner on a such a subject has got be very hard to do. So far the
best book I found to recommend people that still believe in "there's good sides
to capitalisms and international institutions".

The last part of the book, unsurprisingly, is the most depressing. I appreciate
the author willingness to instill some hope into this fight but it didn't have
that effect on me.

All in all, highly recommend book.

## Wild Fictions

{{< book id="222826902" title="Wild Fictions" name="wild-fictions.jpg" width="200" >}}

Slowly getting through all of Gosh books. I love his writing style and his
thoughts are often very deep and thought provoking. This book is no exception
but the topics were not as interesting to me personally.

{{</ book >}}

## Hamas

{{< book id="9396395" title="Hamas" name="hamas.jpg" width="200" >}}

Very well written history of Hamas. I don't agree with the framing of everything
but it's so much better than what an avg EU journalist would write. Recommended.

{{</ book >}}

## Miramar

{{< book id="57900728" title="Miramar " name="miramar.jpg" width="200" >}}

First book from Naguib Mahfouz. I loved the writing style. It's a mix of "everyday
conversations" and extremely lyrical descriptions, I especially loved the weather
descriptions.

{{</ book >}}

## In an Antique Land

{{< book id="12028910" title="In an Antique Land" name="in-an-antique-land.jpg" width="200" >}}

As per usual, I enjoyed the writing. It's definitely not as good as his other
books and felt a little long. All in all, I'm happy I read it though.

## Imperialism and Unequal Development

{{< book id="1834905" title="Imperialism and Unequal Development" name="imperialism-and-unequal-development.jpg" width="200" >}}

Difficult and technical read (for me I mean) but I enjoyed the book nonetheless.

## The General of the Dead Army

{{< book id="223666" title="The General of the Dead Army" name="the-general-of-the-dead-army.jpg" width="200" >}}

I read this book at a weird time of my life (during an international move) so my
memories of it reflect more my emotional state than the emotions the writing
generated. Having said that, quite a beautifully told story.

{{</ book >}}

## Una trilogia palestinese

{{< book id="42366251" title="Una trilogia palestinese" name="una-trilogia-palestinese.jpg" width="200" >}}

Among the absolutely best writing I've ever come across. It's obviously a
painful read but you really shouldn't miss it.

## The Destruction of Palestine Is the Destruction of the Earth

{{< book id="218537050" title="The Destruction of Palestine Is the Destruction of the Earth" name="the-destruction-of-palestine-is-the-destruction-of-the-earth.jpg" width="200" >}}

This may be the first political book written by a white man I completely agree
with. In fact, top book just for that.  But there's obviously more to it, I
learned about the year 1840 and gained one more connection on the colonialism is
capitalism is climate crisis map.

## Le poesie

{{< book id="53491073" title="Le poesie" name="le-poesie.jpg" width="200" >}}

I loved Pavese growing up and decided to read his poetry because the first poem
in the book is incredible. Unfortunately no other poem in the book is that good
for me. But take my opinion with a grain of salt, I don't really understand
poetry.

{{</ book >}}

## Il caos

{{< book id="40390214" title="Il caos" name="il-caos.jpg" width="200" >}}

This book had me change my opinion on Pasolini I think. I'll have to try and read
more from him now that I'm an adult but this read very badly to me. Confusing
writing, elitist opinions. I was really surprised to be honest.

{{</ book >}}

## Requiem

{{< book id="24894732" title="Requiem" name="requiem.jpg" width="200" >}}

An interesting, short novel. The imagery is interesting, the atmosphere is
memorable. Definitely worth reading.

{{</ book >}}

## Broken April

{{< book id="17902" title="Broken April" name="broken-april.jpg" width="200" >}}

Difficult read because I was in a strange emotional time while going through
this. All in all though, I'd recommend.

{{</ book >}}

## L'amore

{{< book id="43306411" title="L'amore" name="lamore.jpg" width="200" >}}

I liked the idea of this book more than its execution. Easy to read which is
always great.

{{</ book >}}

## Pappagalli verdi. Cronache di un chirurgo di guerra

{{< book id="3564356" title="Pappagalli verdi. Cronache di un chirurgo di guerra" name="pappagalli-verdi-cronache-di-un-chirurgo-di-guerra.jpg" width="200" >}}

Painfully necessary read. It's very short but will punch you in the gut many
many times. War from the perspective of a person that only thought of helping
those in needs.

Gino Strada is more of a christian that entire christian countries.
