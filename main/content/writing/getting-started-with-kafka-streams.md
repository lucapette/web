Ever since I started working with Kafka Streams I have been noticing an
interesting, somewhat polarising phenomenon around it. The developers I talk to
about Kafka Streams fall in two extreme categories.

They're either experts and really get the power of this technology, its
beautiful design, and its powerful ideas. Or they're intrigued by the praises
but they never managed get into it so their understanding of the basics of Kafka
Streams is not sufficient.

By talking with many people in the second group, I collected a number of
questions I'm hoping to answer with this article but, before we dive into it, a
quick note about [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

While I personally enjoy working with Kotlin, I'm not trying to make some point
about it by using it here. There's nothing special about it in the context of
Kafka Streams applications.

The main reason I chose it for this article is that it's syntax is much terser
than Java so the few snippets I'll share may even look like pseudo-code.

Having said that, let's dive into the wonderful world of Kafka Streams
applications together, shall we?
