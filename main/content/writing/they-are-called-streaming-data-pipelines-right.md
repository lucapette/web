The (long but what's new) article you're reading is the background story of
[TypeStream](https://github.com/typestreamio/typestream), an open-source
streaming platform that allows you to write and run typed data pipelines with a
minimal, familiar syntax. It's the tale of how an intuition I had almost a
decade ago developed into the three foundational ideas that make TypeStream.

I tried my best to make sections independent but I recommend reading them in
order as they're connected to each other the way they're presented:

## The first intuition

Almost a decade ago, I was the CTO at Marley spoon, a small and cool startup
making the best meal kit delivery service.

One day, this must have been spring of 2016, I was in a meeting with the
engineering and product leadership. We were discussing how to leverage Kafka so
that our teams could work more independently.

We had a web store and some batch jobs "producing" orders and a variety of
services "consuming" them to implement a variety of use-cases. Kafka acted as a
transport layer and a "api" between the two worlds via a change data capture
pipeline. I'm sure this architecture is familiar to many of you, especially now
that change data capture is widely known. Back then, it was a bit more novel so
my team was a little hesitant.

The consuming side of this architecture intrigued me: there were too many
abstraction levels between our conversation and our tooling. It felt clumsy and
inefficient to me.

Now before I explain what I mean with "abstraction levels" in the context of
that meeting, let me clarify that I'm specifically talking about abstractions in
the context of developer experience. The obvious point being that we didn't
create programming languages because they were better than assembly for the
machine. We did it to improve developer experience. They're called "high level
programming languages" exactly because they're several levels of abstraction
away from the machine needs.

Of course a mismatch between the abstraction level at which humans discuss some
data operations and the one their tooling provides is to be expected. The point
is that the closer the two abstraction levels are, the more productive humans
can be.

Now that it's clearer I'm talking about developer experience, let me go back to
the meeting where I first thought of this mismatch in the context of data
pipelines.

Here's the scenario: we streamed orders to Kafka with a rudimental (by todays
standards) change data capture pipeline. Almost no consumer needed every order,
most needed a subset of orders (things like "orders to ship", "orders to pack in
NL") or parts of a subset (things like "customer's emails of orders to ship",
"list of ingredients of orders to pack in NL").

Conceptually, data operations like "orders to ship" and "list of ingredients of
orders to pack in NL" were simple data operations. But, in practice, extracting
data from Kafka topics, process them, and then send them around to other
services required us to discuss lots of details. The serialization format of the
data, the schema (what if it changes?), the actual streaming application (what
language we write this in?). Everything about it felt very low level and broke
our ability to think about these problems at a high enough abstraction level.

Looking at diagrams on a whiteboard I couldn't help but think that most of our
data pipelines were composable little functions. We could combine them by
calling each function on the result of the previous one. Now a more
mathematically inclined person would explore this concept further but I'm a
programmer so I saw a different, I dare to say, more obvious metaphor at play.
These little functions you can call one after the other looked a lot like UNIX
pipelines. Each function type is a UNIX command that does one thing, calling
them in sequence is just a command pipe.

This intuition about abstraction level mismatch between tooling and data
operations lead me to ask myself what if we could express data pipelines like
UNIX pipelines? TypeStream is my answer to that question.

## Data pipelines are UNIX pipelines

If we had TypeStream back at MarleySpoon, getting orders to ship may look like
this:

```sh
let orders_to_ship=$(cat orders | grep [.state == 'to_ship'])
```

Getting emails something like this:

```sh
cat $orders_to_ship | cut .email
```

It felt right to me but it also confused me because, for the first time in my
career, I wanted to build something that I found both really obvious and pretty
hard to build. A strange (in a good way) combination. In fact, I didn't even try
building a prototype back then. I had no idea how to write my own programming
language and Kafka Streams (which is TypeStream only runtime right now, more on
this later) was very young, Also, in spring 2016, I knew nothing about it.

Nowadays, the experience got much better. Thanks to amazing progress of
technology like [Kafka
Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/),
[ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), and [flink](https://flink.apapche.org), you can
reason about streaming data pipelines at a much higher level. The thing is
though... it's not high-level enough 🙃

Now, before I go deeper into explaining why TypeStream is a thing and why I
think that it should be a bigger thing, allow me a short personal detour.

I find discussing these ideas in public quite overwhelming. There's a part of me
that constantly nudges me with doubts like:

- This gotta be a bad idea if no one else sees it _your_ way.
- TypeStream is probably too hard to build _for you_.

Maybe you'll call it impostor syndrome, maybe not. It doesn't matter. I'm not
sharing this so we can fight my doubts together. I'm doing so because I need to
clarify that, while my arguments may not come across as strong as they could
because of self-doubts, I _genuinely_ don't understand why approaching data
pipelines the way I'm thinking about them (aka the UNIX way) isn't more common.
I'd go as far as saying this should be the _default_ way. After all, there's the
word "pipe" in "data pipelines", isn't there? This abstraction fits so well the
problem space I feel weird "stealing" it for TypeStream.

All right, done with that. Where were we? Yes, I was saying that the Kafka
community made great progress. We made big abstraction jumps from "here is the
consumer group api javadoc" to Kafka Streams, ksqlDB, flink (to name a few).
And, yes, I was also saying that it's not high level enough :)

What is high level enough then? Well, UNIX pipelines are almost English. That is
high level enough for me. This is the first foundational idea behind TypeStream:
data pipelines _are_ UNIX pipelines.

At some point last year, I decided I had to look at Kotlin more closely. The
project "write a bash-like pipe to Kafka Streams applications compiler" was the
kind of project I needed to learn Kotlin. There's no direct connection between
Kotlin and TypeStream but I can't learn a new programming language through
fictional exercises. I need something complex enough I can go at it for a few
weeks in a row. So here I was, finally trying to go one more level up the ladder
of abstraction I already wanted all the way back in spring of 2016.

The first few weeks were really fun. I got to put in practice a big chunk of the
"Crafting interpreters", a magnificent book that gets you started on writing a
programming language and not on talking about writing one. By the time I could
compile trivial pipelines I had spent quite some time thinking about TypeStream
and discovered two more ideas that, together with "data pipelines are UNIX
pipelines", make the foundation of what TypeStream is today.

## Everything is a stream

Because I'm a pretty sceptical person that likes to sabotage their own plans
(I'm fun like that), while prototyping TypeStream I found myself in a strange
two-step self-feeding feedback loop:

1. I asked myself something along the lines of "well if TypeStream were a good
idea, then you could do X but sure you can't, right?"
2. I immediately found solid answers via the "UNIX metaphor". I was happy for a
   minute and then back to 1.

This is where the second foundational idea behind TypeStream comes in place.
See, when I had the intuition of expressing a pipeline like, say, "filter book
by word count > 20k" as a UNIX pipe, I didn't put go any further than imagining
this:

```sh
cat /dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/books | grep [.word_count > 20_000]
```

By the time I had a working compiler and was running my first TypeStream
pipelines, I realized there's a second powerful idea hiding in plain sight here:
the virtual filesystem.

> In UNIX, everything is a file. In TypeStream, everything is a stream.

It's obvious: the core metaphor doesn't work without a filesystem!

Addressing data sources as filesystem paths felt so natural that I didn't
immediately realize its profound implications.

For example, how would you expect to address a postgres table? Does
`/dev/postgres/db1/tables/customers` look reasonable? I think it does. When I
pitch TypeStream to backend developers or data engineers, this is completely
obvious for them. There are no questions about the general idea of how a "data
mesh filesystem" should look like.

While it's natural to think of data sources as filesystem paths, it may be a
little harder to see how well this idea fits with typical data operations. For
example, you may want to expose data via a websocket this way:

```sh
cat /dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/books | grep The | cut .id .title > /media/websocket/server1/books_notifications
```

"mounting" external "media" works great, right? Think of
`/media/elastic/cluster1/index_01` or `/media/http/server1/endpoint`. Why not?
It looks so natural.

Now let me put these two foundational ideas together and imagine how TypeStream
would deal with some common scenario. For example: stream data out of a
relational database, apply some business filtering to it, send the filtered data
around. A concrete trivial, real-world application of this scenario is sign-up
flow processes.

Here's how I imagine TypeStream taking care of capturing new users out of a
postgres database, publish them to some Kafka topic for later consumption, and
send a welcome email to new users via a transactional email service:

```sh
let new_users = $(cat /dev/postgres/tables/users | grep [.op == 'insert'])

cat $new_users > /dev/kafka/topics/users.new
cat $new_users | cut .id .email > /media/email/welcome
```

It's surprisingly succinct. But brevity isn't the focus, that's the accidental
benefit of a good abstraction. The win is that TypeStream abstraction gives you
clarity over brevity. This example is very succinct but lost almost none of the
clarity of the natural language description.

The abstraction levels are now close enough that some tech already covers the
gap between TypeStream and natural language. GitHub Copilot, for example,
produces valid TypeStream pipelines from plain English comments very often! A
testament to the simplicity and validity of the core ideas behind TypeStream.

After all, I invented nothing and I take no credit: UNIX pipes were there long
before I was born.

## It is called TypeStream for a reason

At this point, if you may be wondering how does TypeStream take care of things
like `cat $new_users | cut .id .email`? What's the secret ingredient that makes
it so simple and succinct?

This is where the third foundational idea comes in. It may seem less relevant to
the conversation because it doesn't directly borrow (I mean steal) from UNIX.
On the other hand though, it's so important to the developer experience it gave
TypeStream its name.

TypeStream can type-check pipelines before you run them. It has a key-value
store where keys are filesystem paths and values are serialization format
independent schema types. A key value pair looks like this:

```properties
/dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/books=Struct[title: String, wordCount: Int]
```

So when you're trying to run the following pipeline:

```sh
cat /dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/books | grep [.name ~= "the"]
```

the compiler tells you "hey there's no name field on books" and spare you the
pain of finding out later in the process.

The types metadata also help TypeStream by allowing its user a notable omission
in their TypeStream pipelines: there's no mention of serialization formats
anywhere. Is this topic avro, protobuf, json schema? The question is irrelevant
to designing a data pipeline. If you know the shape of the data you're working
with, its serialization format _is_ irrelevant for you.

One day, while prototyping the type checker, I realized TypeStream had enough
metadata information to do some type inference on data pipelines.

Since the compiler knows the schema type of each "path" and knows the effect of
each data operator on a schema type, it can infer the resulting schema types of
each pipeline. Consider these examples:

```sh
cat /dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/books | cut .id .title > /media/http/server1/endpoint
```

TypeStream can infer that the resulting schema type is something like
`Struct[id: String, title: String]` and produce reasonable JSON for the "HTTP
media". Again, it's about developer experience: you don't need to specify the
shape of the resulting data set, TypeStream can figure it out. It also works
with more complex pipelines. Consider a "typical" enrichment pipeline:

```js
cat /dev/kafka/cluster1/topics/page_views                  |
enrich {p -> http "https://api.country.is" | cut .country} |
wc --by .country
```

Here, the compiler calculates the resulting type by "merging" page views with
the shape of "something with a string country field" that the enrichment block
produces. And then use that resulting type to type-check `--by .country`. If
you'd be redirecting this pipeline to, say, a redis store, TypeStream would use
the resulting schema type to make an informed decision on which which data
structure to create inside the redis store. One more time, it's about developer
experience: TypeStream abstracts so many irrelevant details away by leveraging
"ancient" programming concepts like UNIX pipelines and filesystem paths.

## The power of abstraction

I want to conclude this discussion about TypeStream like I started it:
abstractions. While pitching TypeStream to developers and data engineers I
learned that some powerful abstractions TypeStream enables are not obvious in
the context of the "UNIX metaphor". But they're equally important to the
developer experience so let me get to them.

### Abstractions outlive implementations

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1716878504044998914) by
[Gunnar Morling](https://morling.dev):

> An interesting recurring theme in data infra: protocols/APIs outliving
> specific implementations. E.g. #Kafka wire protocol (#RedPanda, #WarpStream as
> alternative providers), S3 API (#MinIO, #Ceph, etc.), #Postgres protocol (too
> many to list even).

applies perfectly well to TypeStream but it's not obvious unless we consider the
implications of its technical implementation.

At its very core, TypeStream is a "remote compiler": you give it some bash-like
code and TypeStream compiles it into a Kafka Streams application and run the
application for you.

The key point is that, exactly because it's a compiler, Kafka Streams is "just"
a runtime. A powerful and easy to use runtime which is why I started with it.
But that doesn't mean it's the only possible runtime. TypeStream could compile
pipelines into flink jobs, pulsar applications, google pub/sub pipelines,
whatever. TypeStream can outlive its runtime because it's built like a small
programming language so it can abstract away the runtime for you. In fact, it
already does: there's no mention of Kafka Streams in a TypeStream pipeline.

### I don't want to bash SQL but

As Sarah Catanzaro once said: [abstractions
matter](https://twitter.com/sarahcat21/status/1719025058734379196).

The way I read her tweet is that abstractions greatly contribute to the building
experience. It's how I got here.

This is why, despite not being a huge fan of the bash-like programming
languages, I still went for it with TypeStream. You know UNIX pipelines, you
know most of TypeStream. There's no new abstraction for you so the developer
experience isn't a taxing learning experience. Pipes and redirections apply to
data naturally. Files are data. Streams are data. The _right_ abstraction wins
over "better" syntax.

There's also a bolder claim hidden here which I think may be not obvious. I'm also
saying that UNIX pipelines are a _better_ abstraction for data pipelines than
SQL like languages are.

TypeStream and SQL-like languages are more or less at the same abstraction level
but I think TypeStream fits the problem space better because of the three
foundation ideas I shared:

- data pipelines are unix pipelines. Most UNIX commands have natural
  streaming/data operations counterpart (did you know there's a `join` command
  in UNIX? That's what I mean!)
- A virtual filesystem hides lots of details. You don't need any special syntax
  to configure/interact with external sources ("media mounting").
- TypeStream treats types like a strongly typed programming language would. It
  already has basic type checking and basic inference. In the future, it'll
  allow you, for example, to refactor data pipelines across a whole organization
  automatically. Just like your favourite strongly typed language does.

To be clear, I **love** SQL. There's nothing better in the scenario "I got this
data question, give me the answer?". I apply this principle to code too.
Meaning, no-orm for me please. So I'm not trying to bash SQL here, there's
nothing wrong with it. I'm saying they're called data _pipe_-lines so a language
with pipes fits the problem better.

### Naming is hard

The most challenging aspect of talking about TypeStream is to tell people what
it is in a few words. I'm not familiar with any good cultural equivalent,
meaning I can't say something like "TypeStream is X for streaming data
pipelines". The unknown variable here is unclear because TypeStream is a small
programming language but also a platform? So I settled for this:

> TypeStream is an open-source streaming platform that allows you to write and
> run typed data pipelines with a minimal, familiar syntax.

This is a good first attempt at describing something that uses lots of
well-known abstraction in a novel way. I say "naming is hard" because I'm not
convinced "platform" conveys well enough the abstraction TypeStream puts in
place here. TypeStream isn't _just_ a compiler. It is also an orchestrator for
data pipelines. The official TypeStream CLI has a run command that looks like
this:

```sh
typestream run <source-code>
```

When you invoke this command, TypeStream compiles your code and, given there are
no errors (type-checking is nice!), it launches your pipeline inside a
Kubernetes job. The interesting bit here is that TypeStream abstracts the
runtime of your pipelines away. There's no mention anywhere in your source code
that it will run in production as a Kafka Streams application. That's because
Kafka Streams is _just_ a runtime and if your pipeline should run as, say, a
pulsar application, TypeStream will happily compile your source code to it and
run it for you.

Note that here I'm talking about a different idea than "just outliving" a
runtime. As a platform, "TypeStream" abstracts both _where_ and _how_ your data
pipelines runs. In theory, knowing the shape (the schema) of your data sources
and what to do with them is all you need to write and run a data pipeline. In
practice, it's not that easy. That's TypeStream core argument: it could so it
should be that easy.
