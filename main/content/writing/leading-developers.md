[Leading developers](https://leadthe.dev) is a short book about engineering
management I self-published on 21 February 2023.

In the process of writing and publishing it, I took notes knowing I would want
to reflect on the experience as soon as I was done with it. So here I am.

## Writing the book

First of all a confession: I published the book in February 2023 but I wrote it
on a speed run in the spring of 2017. I'm not sure how long it took as I have
almost no memories left of the actual "writing experience" and can't speak to
that.

I remember how I approached the structure of the book though. Instead of coming
out with some meaningful structure, I dumped on paper all I knew about leading
developers and let the design of the chapters emerge from the content. This
approach worked because I was deeply familiar with the subject and had already
lots of writing I could use as starting point.

Nowadays, I'm also convinced I speed-ran the writing because I wanted to free
myself of my own leadership ideas. OK, time for another confession: I don't
enjoy leading teams anymore. To be fair, I think I never did.

Writing the book helped me realise that yes, I loved the teams I built, I loved
the way they worked together, what the people had achieved, their professional
growth. But no, I didn't like the job. In fact, I kind of hated my everyday job.

There was a difference between what the outcomes of my job and the job as a
daily routine that wasn't clear to me until I sat down to write the book. By the
time I got this, I had also finished a first draft.

Realising I didn't really want to lead teams anymore is one of the main reasons
why I parked the book for years. Sure, there was a pandemic in the middle that
changed all time perception equations but, to be honest, I think it had no
impact on the book.

I only picked up the book again because, and you can't make this up, I want to
write _more_ books ðŸ™ƒ

My dumb brain works like this: "Yo! You can't do that unless you ship the one
you already wrote 4 years ago. Remember that book?".

I don't think that's a good reason to go through the process I went through
(which I'll cover in detail throughout the rest of the article) but I'm glad I
couldn't get myself to start another book before shipping this one.

Two reasons:

- I learned a lot about the process of going from a book draft to a finished
  book. I cover that in the next paragraph.
- I build a little of infrastructure for self-publishing which I'm sure it'll
  come handy in the near future (yes, I'm writing _another_ book already). I
  cover that in [publishing the book](#publishing-the-book), including why I
  went down the road of self-publishing.

## Reviewing the book

As a writer, the review process was by far the most valuable experience in the
whole process. I write a lot and also love writing about writing (yes, I know
but [On writing]({{< ref "/writing/on-writing" >}} "On writing") is a good
article ðŸ™ƒ) so I went into this phase a little too confident I knew how to do
this.

Compared to my usual article review process, there were two complications.

First of all, five years had passed since I first wrote the book. Do I still
agree with 2017 Luca? Legit question, half a decade is a significant amount of
time. I overestimated the problem a little. The time distance helped me update
the content: I had no memory of writing any of it so there was no emotional
attachment.

This experience gave a whole new perspective to what Stephen King does when he
writes a book. He always takes a break of a few weeks between the first draft of
a new book and the review process. I _understand_ this now.

The other, way too obvious, complication is that my book is much longer than my
average article. My usual workflow didn't work at this scale which, in
retrospect, looks funny. Let me explain.

The first two times I went over the whole book, I did one or two chapters a day
in the order they're published. By the time I got to the last two chapters, I
was tired. I had depleted my willpower to rethink sentences, trim words out,
simplify, or delete. These sessions took a few days. By the end of it I was
totally unsatisfied with the result.

So I tried to review chapters out of order. Or better put, I prioritized the
chapters I was the most unhappy with. I did two more passed this way and the
results were much more satisfying. I was doing the hard work first so by the end
of these days long sessions I was only checking commas.

What's funny to me here is that I was reviewing a whole book from start to
finish like it was an article. No process works as well at two different order
of magnitudes. I should have known better, I've said this myself hundreds of
times.

## Publishing the book

Before I dive into which tools I chose and why, I should mention why I decided
to self-publish. Well, no one wanted it.

I sent the book to four different publishing companies. Here's what happened:

- I got one "real" rejection: someone actually explained me why the book didn't
  work for them.
- Two automated rejections.
- One publishing company didn't answer (of course, my favourite of the four did
  this!).

The most obvious outcome of course and I knew that before pitching them my book.
I did so anyway because "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take". Also, I'll
expand in [marketing the book](#marketing-the-book), I knew the effort I had to
put into pitching wouldn't go lost.

Once the rejections came in, I started looking into self-publishing. Here are my
initial requirements:

- I wanted HTML, ePUB, and PDF versions. I assumed ePUB and PDF the required
  formats because it's what most publishing companies sell (at least in tech). I
  added the HTML version because I wanted the book to be freely available.
- I did not want to deal with LaTeX. My uni thesis scarred me for life.

With this in mind, I started to search for possible solutions and quickly
discovered that it's a bazaar out there when it comes to self-publishing,
there's way too much marketing material and way too little concrete information
(one of the main reasons why I'm writing this article). In my research I came
across:

- Too many "lead generation" articles about self-publishing. Infuriatingly
  useless.
- [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/). A platform I'm very fond of as I was a very
  early tester. I think it's a great choice but I couldn't convince myself a
  subscription model would work for me.
- [Ulysses.app](https://ulysses.app/). A beautiful macOS application. It has a
  polished UI and the default PDF/ePUB output is nice. I was tempted I didn't
  want to put my customization efforts into a proprietary solution.

I decided I wasn't comfortable enough with any of this which is how I ended up
with a custom [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) toolchain.

### Pandoc

At first sight, pandoc seems to good to be true. I got decent ePUB and PDF
formats in no more than 15 minutes. Unfortunately, going from decent to good
took much longer than that.

In case you have never heard of pandoc, here's how the official docs describe
it:

> If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is
> your swiss-army knife.

In practice, pandoc is a command line application that allows you to do things like this:

```sh
pandoc -o book.epub *-*.md
```

and just like that you get a decent ePUB document! You can do the same with another format:

```sh
pandoc -o book.pdf *-*.md
```

which gives you a decent PDF document. I think you could also do HTML documents
this way but I didn't dive into this because [mdbook](#why-mdbook)'s default
output was great so I decided to use that for HTML. More about this later.

As you can see, pandoc has an impressive out of the box experience but,
understandably, the defaults didn't work for me. Here's what I wanted to
achieve:

- HTML, ePUB, PDF formats.
- Internal links work in all formats.
- The documents have a working table of contents.
- I have page numbers in the PDF format.
- I want to style font, line height, page size, and son.

It doesn't seem like much, and to be frank it isn't, but I had to learn how
pandoc works to achieve these goals.

So let's have a quick look at how pandoc works. In short, pandoc is a data
pipeline that looks like this:

![pandoc data pipeline](/img/pandoc.svg)

A simple idea! For the sake of this conversation, let's consider the markdown to
ePUB example again:

```sh
pandoc -o book.epub *-*.md
```

When you run this command, pandoc uses its markdown reader to read and convert
the input documents into a "pandoc AST (abstract syntax tree)". Then it passes
the AST to the ePUB writer which converts it into an ePUB document. It's an
elegant solution to the "convert between all markup formats" problem.

I wanted to make two kinds of customizations: styles (font, sizes) and content
(links). I used CSS for style which felt very good, and "pandoc filters" for
links which also felt good but I had to learn one more thing before I could do
this.

Let's talk about CSS first. The reason why I ended up with CSS is two-fold:

- ePUB customization works out of the box with CSS.
- PDF customization in pandoc is possible with LaTeX and CSS. I don't do LaTeX.

After some research, here's what I ended up with:

- A [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) pre-processor step for both PDF and ePUB
  format. I wanted to use variables. Nothing fancy.  I processed my CSS styles
  with PostCSS and passed the processed file to pandoc. Easy.
- [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) as a PDF engine. It supports modern CSS
  features so I could get things like "alternating-sides page numbers" with 2
  lines of code. Really cool!

Once this pipeline was in place, I only needed to make internal links work
everywhere. By default, internal links don't work in PDF or ePUB documents
because they point to the physical name of the input document:

- What I have: `[when to split teams](5-teams.md#when-to-split-teams)`
- What I need: `[when to split teams](teams#when-to-split-teams)`

That's where [filters](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) come in. In the words of
the official docs:

> Pandoc provides an interface for users to write programs (known as filters)
> which act on pandocâ€™s AST.

A simple idea again: you can write little programs (in
[Lua](http://www.lua.org/)) that hook into the AST stage and let you manipulate
its nodes before the writing stage. To make links work, here's what I wrote:

```lua
function Link(el)
  if string.match(el.target, "^%d") then
    print(el.target)
    title = string.find(el.target, "#.*")
    if (title ~= nil) then
      el.target = string.sub(el.target, title)
    else
      el.target = "#" .. string.sub(el.target, 3, -4)
    end
  end
  return el
end
```

Since the function is called like the AST node it acts upon, this will work with
no additional code (the beauty and the curse of "convention over
configuration"). Then I passed the filter to pandoc:

```sh
pandoc --lua-filter links.lua *_*.md -o book.pdf
```

which fixed links in both formats and I was good to go!

I have not made the pipeline code public yet but reach out to me if you're
interested and I will.

### Why mdBook

In the words of the official docs, [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is:

> a command line tool to create books with Markdown.

As I said, I decided to go for it because I love its default output. It's very
readable and has a nice navigation. I think I was also a little tired of the
work I had done to get ePUB and PDF formats to an acceptable quality level.

The only customization I had to do here is about the file structure. My one
chapter per markdown file approach didn't produce a navigable structure (I'm not
complaining, I understand mdBook approach here). So I wrote a small Ruby script
that converts the structure of the input files for me. You can check out the the
free online version at [https://book.leadthe.dev](https://book.leadthe.dev).

## Marketing the book

This was the hardest part for me. Writing a bit of copy on
[https://leadthe.dev](https://leadthe.dev) to convince readers to buy something
I wrote proved to be quite the psychological challenge.

I think there's more than one reason at play here but I believe the core problem
is that I wrote a book about a job I don't really look forward to having again.
That's awkward to me.

So what I ended up doing is reading all the engineering management books I could
get my hands on. I was just looking for excuses _not_ to ship the book.
Something along the lines of "the books out there cover everything, they're so
good! No need for one more!".

But I couldn't prove that. In fact, reading these books ultimately convinced me
to ship mine because I think I covered a gap in the market with my _build your
own leadership framework_ approach and my head of Engineering/CTO at an
early-stage startup target audience. More importantly, I shipped it, learned a
lot on the way, and now have a good understanding of what it takes to ship a
book. I wish I had it done it sooner :)
