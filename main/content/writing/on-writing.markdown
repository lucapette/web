Degas is a well-known French painter. Less-known is the fact that he played
around with poetry. One day he explained to the poet Stéphane Mallarmé his
struggle with writing. He said he had many ideas and yet he couldn't write.
Mallarmé answered:

> Poems are not made out of ideas. They're made with words.

This is the best definition of writing I've ever come across: it's all about the
words.

The way you connect them, the way you get rid of them. It's about each sentence
you choose, how you craft the rhythm of your sentences.

Varying between short sentenced and longer ones gives a personal touch to your
writing. It helps _my_ writing a great deal.

I just did that.

## Writing in a second language

I have always dedicated time to writing but my personal life got in the way of
my fluency.

Moving to Germany had a big impact because speaking a different
language at work fundamentally changed the way I think.

I often catch myself thinking in English. I even dream in English. While I'm
grateful about the experience, it had a negative impact on my writing.

I feel limited when I write in English. I know I'm not a native speaker and I
feel it every single time I write.

Writing doesn't feel clear and fluid, there's too much clutter.

I'm clumsy but I've never felt that way about my writing.

My experience as a student spoilt me. I was "the good writer" in any class. I
put no effort and yet my writing was good.

The experience gap between my Italian writing and the English one blocked me. I
did not know how to fix it and a few years passed.

That's how life works: if you do nothing, nothing happens. But I couldn't just
give up on writing. I like it too much. I like the act itself, it calms me down.
It gives me the silence that's so hard to find in this frenetic world.

So I did what I always do when I want to know more about something: I read a few
books.

I must confess I was sceptical. I've always thought of writing as something
you're good at; that was my personal experience growing up.

By now, I'm know nothing really works like that. You can get better at anything
if you work on it.

Reading is _my_ first step when I want to understand something better so here is
a list of the books I read with a short review:

### The element of style

The classic everyone recommends. Rightly so: it's a **must-read**.

If you care about improving your English writing, this is the book for you. I
have not got around to buy a dead-tree version yet, so I'm using my Kindle
application to consult it every now and then. But it deserves to live on your
desk.

### On writing well

It's a good book. I loved the first chapters, but I can't say I liked the rest
of the book as much. After the introduction, each chapter covers writing
techniques on different topics (like travelling, interviews) and some of them
were too boring. I did skip some chapters, overall a good read.

### Writing tools

The first two books can teach you most of what matters about writing in English,
so this one may feel a little repetitive.

I enjoyed it anyway for two reasons:

- Each chapters comes with a workshop section. The information is helpful and
  actionable. Great feature.
- Some repetition doesn't hurt when you're learning.

These books taught me that writing works like everything else: if you put hours
of practice in something, you will get better.

We don't think like that when it comes to writing though. We think of artists as
people with innate talent. You're either born like Dostoevskij or you'll always
write crap.

Of course, this isn't true.

Moreover, the goal isn't becoming the most important novelist of all times. The
goal is to enjoying writing.

If you don't intend to write for money, you can ignore the audience. I suggest
you do that anyway though. More on this later.

## Rewriting is the best part of writing

These books taught me something else too. They changed my perspective on the
writing process. They taught me to love the rewriting process.

Before this experience, this was my process:

- Research the topic.
- Take notes.
- Write the draft.
- Proof-read the draft and call it a day.

It was pretty presumptuous of me.

These books, in particular _on writing well_, teach you to love the rewriting
process, they help you understand its value.

I started rewriting my drafts. It was a fascinating learning process. My
sentences got better, writing felt more fluid.

Rewriting my drafts generated some ideas that made me love writing even more. It
forced me to think of ways to get to the first draft as fast and as effortlessly
as possible.

That changed everything and two new writing techniques quickly emerged:

- Note by note.
- Outline expansion.

I couldn't come up with a better naming for now, as a programmer I know how hard
naming can be. I will explain what I mean in the coming paragraphs.

As I kept rewriting my drafts before moving on to proof-reading, I realised I
had never written a draft and rewritten it in one sitting. I had always put at
least a few hours between the sessions.

My explanation is that writing and rewriting require different mindsets.

When I write a draft, my goal is to write everything I have in mind as _fast_ as
possible so I can move on to the _real_ work: the rewriting sessions.

When I rewrite something, my goal is to remove the clutter. I want to get rid
of whatever is superfluous: unnecessary adverbs, adjectives, sentences, entire
paragraphs.

When I started to rewrite my drafts, the question "how much rewriting is
enough?" worried me.

It's a fair question, it comes up often when I talk about writing to people.

I can't say if there's an answer that works for everyone. I don't believe
answers to this kind of question work this way.

I can share my current process though.

I have a two-step process:

1. I do one or two sessions in my editor depending on how long the piece of
   writing is.
2. Then I switch to reading the piece as it was published on my website. It
   helps me to polish my tone. I took mental note of how the piece flows.
3. I go back to the editor and quickly apply my notes to the writing.

Most times I quickly go back between step 2 and 3 a few times until reading
feels right to me.

Sometimes the second step sends me all the way back to "writing mode". I realise
that something about the piece isn't working. The reason isn't important.

What I think matters the most in my process is that I try hard to use a
different perspective in each step.

I'm a writer in in the first step so I use my editor.

I'm a reader in the second one so I do not use my editor. I just read and take
notes.

It fascinates me that I didn't come up with this process, especially the bit
about reading as a writer (meaning through the editor) in the "rewriting mode"
and as a reader (as everyone else would read it) in the "reader mode".

It happened to me over time.

In fact, I rewrote this last part of the paragraph in December 2022, a few weeks
after I realised my process had refined itself. More than 5 years after I wrote
this piece.

### Note by note

I have been trying to write every day for a long time, yet I've struggled to
come up with topics I wanted to write about.

A few weeks ago, I started looking into React (a JavaScript library for building
user interfaces). I was completely new to the topic and the ecosystem around
React can be overwhelming.

I started taking notes to help me with the learning process. After a couple of
coding sessions I was looking at my notes and I realised I could transform them
into a draft with little effort. That was the first time I used the _note by
note_ technique.

So now I take notes about everything I do. I don't care if what I'm writing down
is worth sharing or not.

This way I give myself the chance to take a bunch of notes and transform them
into a draft at a later stage.

Nowadays, I can get from notes to a first draft of over a thousand words in
thirty minutes.

When I'm about to run out of items in my draft queue, I check my notes. I always
find something I can expand into an article. I found a way to write every day.

It _only_ took me seven years.

### Outline expansion

I use [outlining](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)>) every time I
have no clue what I'm doing.

As that's true for most of what I do (and yes, that's true for you too. Don't
lie to yourself my friend), I organise lists this way every day.

When it comes to writing, it helps me to structure ideas that have been on my
mind for a while. This article is a perfect example.

As soon as I started researching how to improve my English writing, I knew I
would want to write about it at some point so I outlined my thoughts this way:

```text
on writing

- use all the day one writing with the "on writing" tag
- Books I read quick review
  - The element of style
  - On writing well
  - Writing tools
- The absolute necessity of getting an editor
- Make a habit out of it
- Build a drafts queue
- Get to the draft as fast as you can:
  - note by note
  - outline with paragraph expansion (use the article itself to explain it)
- Share everything you write (example of the vim article)
```

This is the actual outlined list I used for the article you're reading. The
outline is a guideline for my thoughts. It works like this:

- I paste the outlined list into my editor.
- I expand one point after the other.
- If a point doesn't fit where it is, I move past it.
- If I'm left with points I couldn't expand, I get rid of them.

As you can see from the example above, "make a habit out it" and "the absolute
necessity of getting an editor" did not make it to the final article.

I believe they are important topics but I couldn't find a way to make them flow
with the rest of the content.

Furthermore, "get to the draft as fast as you can" ended up being three
different paragraphs. While writing the article, I realised I cared too much
about "rewriting", so only mentioning it didn't work.

As with the "note by note" technique, I try to expand all the points in one
session, but it doesn't always work.

Sometimes I get tired using this technique, because I don't have enough content
in the outline list already. In that sense, the "note by note" technique is
easier to use.

For example, I wrote the first draft of this article in one sitting. It took me
less than two hours and I couldn't be happier with the result. But it was almost
1900 words and the writing session left me very tired.

## Share everything you write

We have the tendency to overestimate our forecasting capabilities. It's called
[overconfidence effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect). I
feel the effect of this bias every time I publish something.

2017 is a perfect example: the only article I thought wasn't worth sharing got
more attention than the rest of my articles put together. I couldn't believe it.

I decided that the best strategy against this bias is to ignore it completely. I
won't ask myself if an article is worth sharing or not. I'll share whatever I
write because I love writing.

Besides, from time to time someone tells me they found my writing helpful. It's
a beautiful thought: I do something just because I like it and that helps
someone else.

Why wouldn't I take that chance every time I write something?
