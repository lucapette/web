I love reading _and_ I love writing so this kind of between years article should
be natural for me. And yet it is the first time I write something like this. I'm
not even sure why. Hopefully, I'll be able to do this every year from now on.

Since it's the first time I do this, the article is broken down in two parts.
First I go over each book and share a few words. It's a _long_ list because this
was a good reading year.

The [second part](#how-i-extracted-the-data) is a quick description of how I
extracted the data from goodreads and played around with it to create this
article.

## The books

At first, I thought I'd cluster the books for ease of access. But any grouping I
could think of had flaws so I'm presenting the books in the order I read them.

I also decided against sharing a rating for each book because there would be too
many 5-star rating. I tend to rate my books quite high: my average rating on
goodreads is 4.1 (out of 547 read books). This is a consequence of spending a
lot of time researching what to read next. I enjoy the process very much;
bookshops are my happy place.

{{< book id="45152372" title="How to Stop Time" name="books/2022/how-to-stop-time.jpg" width="200" >}}

I had high expectations for this book. I loved [the midnight
library](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library) and
the plot intrigued me very much. It has strong
[Highlander](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)>) vibes, a movie I
loved as a kid.

And yet, I couldn't connect with the book. The story is fascinating, the writing
is very good but there's genuinely nothing going on. Time moves forward, the
story seems stuck. I hoped for a great ending but that also didn't happen.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="56646328" title="Send Help!" name="books/2022/send-help.jpg" width="200" >}}

My wife reads lots of comic strips so I read some for proximity. This wasn't
particularly fun to me but these books are a short time investment it's no big
deal. I just pick one up from time to time.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="248787" title="The World Without Us" name="books/2022/the-world-without-us.jpg" width="200" >}}

I read this book as research for a writing project (now stalled by another one).
The writing was really boring to me and I struggled to finish it. The content is
very interesting though.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="2102600" title="Zoe's Tale" name="books/2022/zoes-tale.jpg" width="200" >}}

This is the fourth book (out of six) in the [Old man's
war](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40789-old-man-s-war) saga. One of my
absolute favourite sci-fi sagas ever. I'm sure I will reread all of it soon
enough.

Moreover, [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/) is one of my favourite
writers in general. His writing style is very engaging and entertaining.

And still I waited a while before reading the second part of this saga. Somehow
I didn't find the premise of "Zoe's Tale" intriguing. It tells a story you
already know through the eyes of a teen.

I was wrong! I loved the book. Zoe's voice is believable (I'm a man though... so
take that with a grain of salt) and the new angle on the story is refreshing. It
does indeed answer some questions I didn't know I wanted answers for. Highly
recommended.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="15698479" title="The Human Division" name="books/2022/the-human-division.jpg" width="200" >}}

Average John Scalzi book: highly entertaining, extremely recommended.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="23168809" title="The End of All Things" name="books/2022/the-end-of-all-things.jpg" width="200" >}}

Average John Scalzi book: highly entertaining, extremely recommended.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="50998056" title="The Ministry for the Future" name="books/2022/the-ministry-for-the-future.jpg" width="200" >}}

This is one of the strangest book I have ever read. I hated the writing style
and really struggled to finish it. It felt like I was reading the first draft of
a masterpiece. Infuriating.

On the other hand, I loved some ideas and a few scenes from the book stayed with
me for months.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="58796563" title="Speed & Scale" name="books/2022/speed--scale.jpg" width="200" >}}

The most important book I read in 2022, hands down. As soon as I finished, I
recommended it to anyone I know. It's well written and makes a compelling
argument to "solve" climate change with the same tools that got us here.

What I think about the plan would need its own article so I spare you that. But
do read it. Also, you want a physical copy of this book. It's really beautiful.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="43633741" title="Kafka in Action" name="books/2022/kafka-in-action.jpg" width="200" >}}

I'm very interested in [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) so it's only natural I
read books coming my way. I bought this book long before it was published. In
fact, when I got it I had forgot about it completely :)

It's a good book and will teach you the basics of Kafka. I remember finding the
examples in the book a little annoying but nothing major.

If I had to recommend one book to get started with Kafka, it wouldn't be this
one though. If that's the book you're looking for, you want to read "Kafka: the
definitive guide".

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="55662833" title="Atomic Kotlin" name="books/2022/atomic-kotlin.jpg" width="200" >}}

When I'm learning a new language, the first thing I do is reading a book about
it. So when I started researching Kotlin I was very pleased to find this book. I
loved "Thinking in Java" back at Uni.

The book did not disappoint. Very good writing, thoughtful examples.
Recommended.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="33369254" title="The Manager's Path" name="books/2022/the-managers-path.jpg" width="200" >}}

This is a little painful to write for me. Because I want to say I loved this
book but I didn't.

[Camille Fourier](https://www.camilletalk.com/) is someone I look up to. I read
many of her blog posts while furiously nodding.

So I think the problem is that I had very high expectations. I'm also convinced
I had the wrong expectations, meaning I though I'd find more useful information
to me personally.

Having said all of this, I think you should read it if you care about
engineering management. It's well written and it's a solid book.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="45303387" title="An Elegant Puzzle" name="books/2022/an-elegant-puzzle.jpg" width="200" >}}

I struggle to write anything constructive about this book. Avoid.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="50363684" title="Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager" name="books/2022/become-an-effective-software-engineering-manager.jpg" width="200" >}}

I confess I went into this book very sceptical about it. Pragmatic programmers
books have this tech bro vibe I'm not really fond of. The title of this book is
in line with that vibe.

But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing and the actionable
advice. This is a great first engineering management book. It reads like a guide
so it's perfect for people that have no experience with the job.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="38821039" title="The Making of a Manager" name="books/2022/the-making-of-a-manager.jpg" width="200" >}}

[Julie Zhuo](https://juliezhuo.com/) is an incredible writer. If you're not
subscribed to her newsletter, you're missing out on great content. So I'm not surprised I loved her book.

It's a personal take on engineering management and reads more like a novel than
a technical book (I mean this as a strong compliment).

Julie's writing is elegant and the stories she tells are engaging. Highly
recommended.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="51163447" title="Building Event-driven microservices"
name="books/2022/building-event.jpg" width="200" >}}

If I hadn't known upfront what this book was about, I'm sure I'd never read it.
What I'm trying to say is that the title is a little off.

It's more abut streaming platforms than "microservices". It's a good overview.
To me, it's a "read if you care about the subject" book. I'm sure some people
will miss on it because of the title though.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="33080122" title="The Calculating Stars" name="books/2022/the-calculating-stars.jpg" width="200" >}}

I've always found alternate history an intriguing sub-genre of sci-fi but in
practise I read very little of it. Not sure why. The "Lady astronaut Universe"
series (three books so far, a fourth on the way) is set into an alternate
history where, in 1952, a huge meteorite destroys much of the east coast of the
United States. The event speeds up the race to space.

I **loved** the whole series. I binge-read all of them in the span of two weeks.
I grew very fond of Elma York (main character in the first two books) and Nicole
Wargin (main character in the third one).

I genuinely can't wait for the next book in the series.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="33081262" title="The Fated Sky" name="books/2022/the-fated-sky.jpg" width="200" >}}

See previous review.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="52381417" title="The Relentless Moon" name="books/2022/the-relentless-moon.jpg" width="200" >}}

See previous review.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="7767021" title="Who Fears Death" name="books/2022/who-fears-death.jpg" width="200" >}}

Nnedi Okorafor is such a spectacular writer that this book doesn't read like a
novel to me. It's poetry. I mean the words don't just bring the story forward.
There's a beauty to her writing that is hard to explain.

I often find myself thinking about Onyesonwu, the main character, months after I
read it. Incredible read.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="50734847" title="Of Ants and Dinosaurs" name="books/2022/of-ants-and-dinosaurs.jpg" width="200" >}}

Cixin Liu is my favourite sci-fi writer. His imagination is immense, he always
surprises me. The remembrance of earth's past is _by a significant margin_ the
most profound sci-fi saga I have ever read.

This book is no exception. It's hard to explain how intriguing this book is.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="50214741" title="The Girl with the Louding Voice" name="books/2022/the-girl-with-the-louding-voice.jpg" width="200" >}}

I loved this book. The journey Adunni goes through is as hard as it's
unforgettable.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="45252" title="Pandora's Star" name="books/2022/pandoras-star.jpg" width="200" >}}

First book in the "Commonwealth saga".

British author Peter Hamilton has the most incredible writing style I have ever
come across:

- The amount of detail in each "scene" he narrates is astonishing.
- The author drives the plot forward with many concurrent storylines involving
  some 50 people or so.

I say _scene_ because the best way I can describe his writing style is: "you're
literally reading a movie". That's how detailed the story is.

If it'd be only technique though, I think I'd lose interest (the book is very
long and I'm sure it lost some readers along the way). But the story itself is
also very intriguing. Space opera at its best.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="39996759" title="A Philosophy of Software Design" name="books/2022/a-philosophy-of-software-design.jpg" width="200" >}}

Difficult subject so I appreciate the effort of trying to write about "how to
design software". I think the book is interesting and worth reading if you're a
programmer.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="45244" title="Judas Unchained" name="books/2022/judas-unchained.jpg" width="200" >}}

Second, and last, book of the "Commonwealth saga". It's as good as the first
one. Incredible journey. Be aware the series seems short because it's just two
books but they're more than 1k pages each so it's more a 7 book series.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="21611" title="The Forever War" name="books/2022/the-forever-war.jpg" width="200" >}}

It's a classic for a reason: the plot is great, the character development is
deep, the ending is perfect. A must-read for any sci-fi aficionado.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="21620" title="Forever Free" name="books/2022/forever-free.jpg" width="200" >}}

The sequel to "the forever war" took quite a turn from the themes of the first
book. I found its ideas intriguing and liked the book. But I understand why some
hated it.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="21618" title="Forever Peace" name="books/2022/forever-peace.jpg"
width="200" >}}

I'm not entirely sure how much this book should be considered part of "the
forever war saga". To be honest I don't care. I loved the story. It would be a
perfect "action sci-fi" movie. But I'd have to do the casting :)

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="18652140" title="Distributed Systems For Fun and Profit" name="books/2022/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit.jpg" width="200" >}}

Available for free at
[http://book.mixu.net/distsys/](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/). A good
introduction to the basic (in the true sense of the word) concepts in the
distributed systems space. A bit dated maybe. But hey it's free, don't complain
too much about it.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="13573419" title="Great North Road" name="books/2022/great-north-road.jpg" width="200" >}}

Another 1k pages book by Peter Hamilton. Same incredible writing technique as
the "commonwealth" saga and a few themes in common. I think some people may
consider this a downside but I can't agree to that because both the writing and
the themes developed in Hamilton's books are _very_ good.

This has the added benefit (for me) that the plot is a murder mystery.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="60280135" title="Upgrade" name="books/2022/upgrade.jpg" width="200" >}}

[Blake Crouch](https://blakecrouch.com/) doesn't know how to write bad books. As
his previous books (recursion and dark matter), this is an absolute page-turner.
In the best sense possible: I just couldn't put it down.

The ending of this book is _really_ profound. I find myself thinking about it
often since I finished it.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="32953140" title="Hourly Billing is Nuts" name="books/2022/hourly-billing-is-nuts.jpg" width="200" >}}

Worth it if you're a freelancer.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="43386931" title="Learn Your Lines" name="books/2022/learn-your-lines.jpg" width="200" >}}

Worth it if you're a freelancer.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="49113465" title="The City in the Middle of the Night" name="books/2022/the-city-in-the-middle-of-the-night.jpg" width="200" >}}

They say "don't judge a book by a cover" but I'm pretty sure I bought this one
because I liked the cover design (and the blue cloth covering!). Well that and
the fact I wanted to read a "sci-fi/fantasy" book.

I found the story a little slow at times but overall I'm very happy I picked it
up. Sophie is a fantastic main character. [The
author](https://www.charliejaneanders.com/) has an incredible imagination. It's
hard not to be fascinated by the world she created.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="57693406" title="The Kaiju Preservation Society" name="books/2022/the-kaiju-preservation-society.jpg" width="200" >}}

This book embarrassed me.

And with that I mean people gave me strange looks in the bus while I was reading
it. I could not stop laughing out loud.

The story is so hilarious I can't wait to forget more of it so that I can read
it again.

Scalzi never misses.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="48829708" title="To Sleep in a Sea of Stars" name="books/2022/to-sleep-in-a-sea-of-stars.jpg" width="200" >}}

Engaging book but also felt a little long. I still consider it an amazing book
because of its conclusion. It took me by surprise and made me smile. Lovely.

Also, it gave so much meaning to its title.

What a journey.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="34507927" title="How to Take Smart Notes" name="books/2022/how-to-take-smart-notes.jpg" width="200" >}}

I had tried to read this book once already a couple of years ago but didn't
finish it then. I decided to give it another try and I'm happy I read it.

I have not integrated the technique described into my reading yet but, to be
fair, I'm reading mostly fiction at the moment and the whole "how to take notes"
idea is more apt for research.

I plan to buy a physical copy in a few months and use it as a playground for
"how to take smart notes". Yeah, it's too meta, I agree.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="50542114" title="Terraform in Action" name="books/2022/terraform-in-action.jpg" width="200" >}}

I was looking to refresh my memory on terraform. The book served the purpose but
I found some examples a little out of place.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="48930266" title="Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain" name="books/2022/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain.jpg" width="200" >}}

Well written. An engaging writing style which is not a given for science related
books.

It's quite short so it's packed with interesting information. I want to re-read
soon-ish so I can take "smart notes" about it.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="29780253" title="Born a Crime" name="books/2022/born-a-crime.jpg" width="200" >}}

A few people recommended me this book over the past few years so it was only a
matter of time before I found the right moment to read it.

Quite glad I did so. It's a great book despite the writing isn't always as good.
Trevor Noah's life experiences are too interesting and his perspective often
surprised me.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="53291342" title="Distributed Services with Go" name="books/2022/distributed-services-with-go.jpg" width="200" >}}

I'm not a big fun of books where you have to build something along with the
author. Nothing wrong with them intrinsically, just a personal preference.

Having said that, I liked the book despite it was heavy on this idea of building
something together with the reader.

The topics covered are intriguing, the order in which they are presented is very
thoughtful.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="24611819" title="The Peripheral" name="books/2022/the-peripheral.jpg" width="200" >}}

Most painful read of 2022. I read it in anticipation of the TV series that came
out in October.

I enjoyed the TV series very much, I really, and I can't stress really enough,
hated the book.

The ideas are quite profound but the writing style ruined everything for me.
Most chapters go on for pages before the author reveals the name of the person
doing things. I really don't get this approach.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="37794149" title="A Memory Called Empire" name="books/2022/a-memory-called-empire.jpg" width="200" >}}

First book of the "Teixcalaan duology".

I loved everything about this book. The ideas, the characters, the writing, the
plot. Arkady Martine is an incredible writer and I can't wait to read what she
writes next.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="58661468" title="Crafting Interpreters" name="books/2022/crafting-interpreters.jpg" width="200" >}}

If you're a programmer, chances are you toyed with the idea of building your own
language. Even just to understand how they work. It turns out they're "just"
computer programs. Some bits are easier than you think, others no so much.

[Bob Nystrom](http://stuffwithstuff.com/) did an incredible job at guiding your
through building a programming language from scratch. He did it twice in the
same book: first with Java and then with C so you can really grok the difference
between an interpreted language and a bytecode, compiled one.

Together with "designing data intensive applications" and "programming pearls",
the best technical book I have ever read.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="45154547" title="A Desolation Called Peace" name="books/2022/a-desolation-called-peace.jpg" width="200" >}}

Second book in the "Teixcalaan duology".

I didn't think I would like it as much as the first one. I was like "nah, the
first one is a masterpiece. No chance this one is as good".

I was wrong. Arkady Martine is way too good.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="6436659" title="Transition" name="books/2022/transition.jpg" width="200" >}}

My first Iain M. Banks book.

It took me a bit to get used to the writing style but then I got completely lost
into this universe of parallel worlds. Profoundly interesting story.

It would make an amazing 10-episode "TV mini series". But, hey, can I do the
casting?

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="10569" title="On Writing" name="books/2022/on-writing.jpg" width="200" >}}

A few weeks ago, I updated one of my favourite writings also called [On
writing]({{< ref "/writing/on-writing" >}} "On writing").

When I shared the updated version, [plaindocs](https://twitter.com/plaindocs)
recommended this. I took that as a sign I should read my first Stephen King
book.

Very glad I did so. The best book on writing I have ever read by far.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="52678845" title="Effective Kotlin" name="books/2022/effective-kotlin.jpg" width="200" >}}

I was looking to deepen my understanding of Kotlin. I picked this one up because
it's written in the spirit of "Effective Java". Not even remotely in the same
league but worth a read.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="59796908" title="Effective Software Testing" name="books/2022/effective-software-testing.jpg" width="200" >}}

I'm just now realising I read two books in a row starting with the same word and
I wonder if that ever happened before 🤔

Anyway, this wasn't a planned read but I went from checking it out to reading
all of it without really realising. A good sign.

I liked the book especially because it gave names to concepts I run over the
course of my career. Definitely worth a read if you're a programmer.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="58502800" title="Engineering Management for the Rest of Us" name="books/2022/engineering-management-for-the-rest-of-us.jpg" width="200" >}}

A magnificent book on engineering management.

{{</ book >}}

{{< book id="61943603" title="The Spare Man" name="books/2022/the-spare-man.jpg" width="200" >}}

I really want to say I loved this book but can't. I had very high expectations
and that may have played a role. But c'mon, a sci-fi murder mystery written
by Mary Robinette Kowal? Also, there's a dog? I couldn't be more excited.

Not trying to say it's a bad book. It's not. But I missed the suspense, the
pace, the intricacies I expect from a murder mystery.

## How I extracted the data

I store all the books I read on goodreads. I'm not particularly happy about it.
It feels like the website is barely alive. After going through the experience
I'm about to share, I decided I'll move somewhere in 2023.

My plan for this blog post was this:

- Get the title, the date read, the cover image of each book I read in 2022.
- Convert the data into prefilled paragraphs (one for each book) so I could
  focus on the writing.

A trivial problem which I had to hack through because goodreads doesn't provide
an API (🙄).

Naturally, I wrote a "script" to extract the data from the HTML from my [year in
book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2022/41861912) goodreads
page. I quoted script because here's what I mean:

```js
copy(
  [...document.querySelector("div.bookCovers").querySelectorAll("a")]
    .map((e) => {
      const img = e.querySelector("img");
      return `${e.href.match(/\d+/)[0]},${img.src}`;
    })
    .join("\n")
);
```

I run this "developer console CSV export" and pasted the clipboard into an
`images.csv`. Yikes. But hey, don't blame me. They don't provide an API 🤷‍♂️.

Since this page doesn't have the date read (🙄), I requested an export of all my
books and downloaded a CSV.

Then I imported the two CSV into sqlite with the _wonderful_ sqlite-utils:

```sh
sqlite-utils insert books.db images images.csv --csv
sqlite-utils insert books.db books goodreads_library_export.csv --csv
```

Wonderful tool (yes I know I just said that. But it's that good you know?).

I had a quick look at the data with datasette to make sure I had the data right.
You can [see it in action](https://hachyderm.io/@lucapette/109489674426663946).

Finally, I exported only the subset of data I needed to stub this blog post and
wrote a quick Ruby script to create the markdown file and download the cover
images.

I really don't want to do this part of the article again :) so I'll be looking
for an alternative way of storing the books I read (unless goodreads magically
ships an API before end of 2023).
