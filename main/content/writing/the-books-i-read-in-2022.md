I love reading _and_ I love writing so this kind of end of the year article
should be natural for me. And yet it is the first time I write something like
this. I'm not even sure why. Hopefully, I'll be able to do this every year from
now on.

Since it's the first time I do this, the article is broken down in two parts.
First I go over each book and share a few words. It's a _long_ list because this
was a good year for my reading habits. I closed the year at exactly a book per
week so it's going to be 52 short paragraphs. The second part is a quick
description of how I extracted the data from goodreads and played around with it
to create this article.

## The books

I thought of grouping the books for faster access. But any grouping I could
think of had flaws so I'm presenting the books in the order I read them.

{{< book id="45152372" title="How to stop time" name="books/2022/how-to-stop-time.jpg" width="200" >}}

Good title, **great** plot idea. Somewhat poor execution. It felt like there was
nothing going on in the book, despite hundred of years passing by.
