I find this quote typical of Gosh work. It's a simple observation and yet I
found it so surprising when I read it.

## p. 35

> At the air force base where my plane had landed there was another, even more

> As always in military matters, the protocols of rank were strictly observed:
> the higher the rank of the officers, the closer their houses were to the water

I admit I'm not 100% sure what Gosh is trying to say here but I loved this
observation, it stayed with me for weeks after I read this book. So, while I
don't really know why it struck me, I like to think about it. Waiting for a
moment of clarity that may never come.

I bring this up a lot in my conversations about the next two decades. I often
find myself telling people that I understand that most things I say sound like a
conspiracy theory but that, in reality, I'm not crazy for preparing myself for
what I think it's coming.

This is in fact exactly the kind of thing I always say that convinces the
average idiotic liberal out there that I'm getting lost into conspiracy
theories. My argument here goes further than Gosh: I'm actually pretty sure most
people in the west can feel they're supporting atrocities but choose to ignore
it because otherwise how do they keep telling themselves they're the good guys?
