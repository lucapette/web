## p. 24

> As a result, my father grew up as an unsupervised young teenager in Singapore.
> Inevitably, he acquired many bad habits. He began to smoke, drink, and gamble.
> With these rough foundations, he ended up having a rough life. I discovered
> these facts only after I had become an adult. Hence, even though my sisters
> and I resented (and sometimes hated) our father when we were young, I came to
> forgive him when I understood that life had dealt him a very bad hand.

In general, I'm a sucker for memoirs and it's quotes like this that make me love
the genre. I know how hard it is to forgive your parents and loved how
vulnerable Mahbubani stayed in the whole book. It sets a tone that makes it more
truthful somehow.

## p. 36

> Since I had experienced poverty all through my childhood and youth, for a long
> time, I associated this period of my life with deprivation. Looking back now,
> it's clear that while I lived with material deprivation, I was absorbing
> cultural richness. Unknowingly and unwittingly, I was inhaling the vapours of
> three of the most dynamic and resilient Asian civilisations: Indian, Islamic,
> and Chinese. This was an extraordinary privilege. Through this direct
> exposure, I could intuitively and unconsciously absorb the deeper thought
> patterns and cultural drives of these rich cultures, which together make up
> half of the world's population.

This resonated with me very deeply. I have a very humble (border-line poor,
really) upbringing and yet I recognize the incredible privilege of growing up
poor in a very rich country. I had free healthcare, I had free education. And
being surrounded by people that could afford more things than me widened my
perspective. I believe this is what made me as empathetic as I'm today. Hard not
be grateful for that.

## p. 81

> Even though my brain was hazy, I managed to scribble a report. I have no idea
> what I said in it, but a few days later, I received a cable from the Foreign
> Ministry saying that they had found my report illuminating and had sent it to
> the Cabinet. This episode confirmed that alcohol and diplomacy go well
> together.

This witty bit caught me by surprise so I decided to include it here.

## p. 149

> Since the Israeli government was not recognised by many Third World
> governments in the 1980s, their ambassadors would not attend a dinner with
> Bibi. Anne and I decided to invite just Bibi Netanyahu and his wife, Fleur, to
> dinner at our residence in New York. We had a good dinner as a foursome. After
> dinner, we opened all the windows of our apartment so that Bibi could enjoy
> his cigar and liqueur. He was quite relaxed by then. This gave me the courage
> to pose an uncomfortable question. I shared with him one undeniable
> demographic statistic: the population of Israel was 4.2 million, while the
> total population of the Arab countries was just under 200 million. I asked
> Bibi how long 4 million people could fight 200 million people. He paused, took
> a few puffs of his cigar, and then replied, "This is why we have a
> stranglehold on the US Congress." qThis fact was, of course, well known. Any

In a post Oct.7 world, it shouldn't be hard to understand why I included this
here. But I also use it as excuse to reiterate on a concept I bring up a lot.
The cancer is the Empire, the rapist colony is just its most violent symptom.
Their relationship is symbiotic of course. But the head of the stake is the US.
Don't fall for it.

Maybe when the book came out these words may have made a stronger impression on
people. Nowadays this should be obvious but I included the quote here so I can
refer to it. Mahbubani words are definitely worth more than mine on diplomatic
matters :)

## p. 211

> A senior Egyptian diplomat told me about a meeting between Omar Suleiman, then
> the director of the General Intelligence Directorate in Egypt, and Dick
> Cheney, who had become vice president of the United States just before the
> Iraq war. Suleiman accurately and perceptively warned that while the invasion
> of Iraq would be easy, the US forces would then be bogged down in a painful
> war of attrition, and many US soldiers would be killed. His prediction proved
> exactly right. But Cheney brushed it aside and just said, "We will kill them
> all."

I bring this story up to explain the US empire was always genocidal so it's good
to have a reference somewhere.

## p. 212

> As the Bush administration, and the American elites in general, were focused
> on the aftermath of 9/11 and the Iraq war, none of them paid careful attention
> to an event of even greater significance than 9/11 that took place in 2001:
> China's admission to the WTO. To be honest, I didn't pay attention to this WTO
> admission either, yet it changed world history far more significantly than the
> Iraq war did.

This is undoubtedly correct. I want to go as far as saying that one day
historians will retro date the start of the collapse of the Empire to 2001.

## p. 243

> Unfortunately, even though peace is critical, we spend far more resources on
> studying war than on studying peace.

No need to comment here right?
