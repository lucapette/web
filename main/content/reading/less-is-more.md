## p. 11

> This is the thing about ecology: everything is interconnected. It's difficult

> On the contrary: our fates are intertwined. They are, in a real sense, us.

Since I read this book (and Gosh work as well), I've been thinking about this a
lot and more than answers I have questions. One in particular: how can close
this gap? We're so obviously *not* disconnected from the rest of the living
creatures of this planet!

> The point here is that the Industrial Revolution – and Europe's industrial
> growth – did not emerge ex nihilo. It hinged on commodities that were produced
> by slaves, on lands stolen from colonised peoples, and processed in factories
> staffed by European peasants who had been forcibly dispossessed by enclosure.
> We tend to think of these as separate processes, but they all operated with
> the same underlying logic. Enclosure was a process of internal colonisation,
> and colonisation was a process of enclosure. Europe's peasants were
> dispossessed from their lands just as Indigenous Americans were (although,
> notably, the latter were treated much worse, excluded from the realm of
> rights, and even humanity, altogether). And the slave trade is nothing if not
> the enclosure and colonisation of bodies – bodies that were appropriated for
> the sake of surplus accumulation just as land was, and treated as property in
> the same way. It might be tempting to downplay these moments of violence as
> mere aberrations in the history of capitalism. But they are not. They are the
> foundations of it. Growth has always relied on processes of colonisation.

Concisely written, I often share this one with people.

## p. 90

> So where does that extra money come from, if it doesn't actually exist? Banks

The obvious conclusion here is that no financial product that people can
speculate on (or, how I like to say, "make money with money") should be legal.

## p. 159

What I find incredible here is the simplicity of the proposal. I can imagine
most people would go "this is impossible" and I think that's the biggest
challenge. The ruling class has colonised people's imagination to the point that
they can't imagine a world without capitalism. It's easier to imagine a world
without humans than one without capitalism.
