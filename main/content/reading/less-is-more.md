## p. 11

> This is the thing about ecology: everything is interconnected. It's difficult
> for us to grasp how this works, because we're used to thinking of the world in
> terms of individual parts rather than complex wholes. In fact, that's even how
> we've been taught to think of ourselves - as individuals. We've forgotten how
> to pay attention to the relationships between things. Insects necessary for
> pollination; birds that control crop pests, grubs and worms essential to soil
> fertility; mangroves that purify water; the corals on which fish populations
> depend: these living systems are not 'out there', disconnected from humanity.
> On the contrary: our fates are intertwined. They are, in a real sense, us.

## p. 35

> The point here is that the Industrial Revolution – and Europe’s industrial
> growth – did not emerge ex nihilo. It hinged on commodities that were produced
> by slaves, on lands stolen from colonised peoples, and processed in factories
> staffed by European peasants who had been forcibly dispossessed by enclosure.
> We tend to think of these as separate processes, but they all operated with
> the same underlying logic. Enclosure was a process of internal colonisation,
> and colonisation was a process of enclosure. Europe's peasants were
> dispossessed from their lands just as Indigenous Americans were (although,
> notably, the latter were treated much worse, excluded from the realm of
> rights, and even humanity, altogether). And the slave trade is nothing if not
> the enclosure and colonisation of bodies – bodies that were appropriated for
> the sake of surplus accumulation just as land was, and treated as property in
> the same way. It might be tempting to downplay these moments of violence as
> mere aberrations in the history of capitalism. But they are not. They are the
> foundations of it. Growth has always relied on processes of colonisation.

## p. 90

> So where does that extra money come from, if it doesn't actually exist? Banks
> create it out of thin air when they credit your account. They literally loan
> it into existence. More than 90% of the money that's presently circulating in
> our economy is created in this manner. In other words, almost every single
> dollar that passes through our hands represents somebody's debt. And this debt
> has to be paid back with interest – with more work, more extraction and more
> production. This is extraordinary, when you think about it. It means that
> banks effectively sell a product (money) that they produce out of nothing, for
> free, and then require people to go out into the real world and extract and
> produce real value to pay for it. It is so outlandish as to offend common
> sense. People have a difficult time believing it could possibly be true. As
> Henry Ford put it in the 1930s: 'It is perhaps well enough that the people of
> the nation do not know or understand our banking and monetary system, for if
> they did I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.'

## p. 159

> What's so fascinating about this is that it shows widespread and intuitive
> support for what ecological economists call a 'steady-state' economy. A
> steady-state economy follows two key principles in order to stay in balance
> with the living world:
>
> 1) Never extract more than ecosystems can regenerate.
> 2) Never waste or pollute more than ecosystems can safely absorb.
>
> To get to a
> steady-state economy, we need to have clear caps on resource use and waste.
> For decades, economists have told us that such caps are impossible, because
> people will see them as irrational. It turns out they're wrong. If given the
> chance, this is exactly the kind of policy that people want.
