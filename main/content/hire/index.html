  My name is Luca Pette (He/Him) and I'm a polyglot developer (Go, Kotlin, Java,
  JavaScript, Ruby, TypeScript) available for hire.
</p>

<p>
  Check out my
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucapette/">Linkedin</a> profile for a
  detailed overview of my work experience and education.
</p>

<h2>Why hire me?</h2>

<p>
  Over the past two decades, I've run engineering teams in a wide variety of
  contexts: corporations, family-run businesses, early stage startups. <br />
  I gained experience building and running infrastructure, backend, data,
  frontend, and mobile systems.
</p>

<p>
  In each of these contexts, a recurring theme emerged: I built many teams and
  systems <em>from scratch</em> which makes me a perfect fit to build your MVP.
</p>

<p>I wrote detailed articles about both aspects of my career:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/writing/my-programming-principles">My programming principles</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/writing/my-engineering-management-values"
      >My engineering management values</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As a programmer, I'm the most fluent solving infrastructure, data, and backend
  problems. That's how I've spent most of my programming career.
</p>

<p>
  While designing UI and UX is not my strong suit, I have lots of experience
  building JavaScript and TypeScript applications. I'm also very fond of React.
</p>

<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>

<p>
  So apart from some <a href="#deal-breakers">deal breakers</a>, I can work in
  any capacity.
</p>

<p>
  I get the most excited with <em><b>infrastructure</b></em
  >, especially development infrastructure like testing pipelines, build tools,
  or <em><b>streaming data platforms</b></em> since I have lots of experience
  with Apache Kafka, its ecosystem, and streaming platforms in general.
</p>

<p>
  While I would advise you not to hire freelancers for leading your teams, I'm
  OK with ad-interim roles if a project excites me and it's the right solution
  for your problem. Context is always key.
</p>

<p>
  I prefer working on one large, difficult problem at a time over many simple
  problems one after the other.
</p>

<p>
  Solving one large problem at a time often leads to a long-lasting mutually
  beneficial working relationship because this is where my technical and
  leadership skills converge.
</p>

<p>
  I'm good at breaking down large problems into small, simple artifacts. I can
  write design proposals for them and coordinate the work.
</p>

<h2 id="deal-breakers">Dealbreakers</h2>

<p>
  While I enjoy working pretty much on any product, do <b>not</b> contact me for
  anything <b>blockchain</b>, and <b>military</b> related.
</p>

<div>
  I also tend to say no to advertising related projects. I may want to make an
  exception if the following conditions are met:
  <ul>
    <li>The technological stack is highly relevant to me.</li>
    <li>
      The goal of the project you want to hire me for is performance related.
      Making systems use less resources is climate friendly.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>At the moment, I cannot take 40-hour per week contracts.</p>
